\n\t20.\n\nEven though he struck the rock so that water gushed out and torrents overflowed, can he also give bread, or provide meat for his people?\u00d3 \n\t21.\n\nTherefore, when the Lord heard, he was full of rage; a fire was kindled against Jacob, his anger mounted against Israel, \n\t22.\n\nbecause they had no faith in God, and did not trust his saving power. \n\t23.\n\nYet he commanded the skies above, and opened the doors of heaven; \n\t24.\n\nhe rained down on them manna to eat, and gave them the grain of heaven. \n\t25.\n\nMortals ate of the bread of angels; he sent them food in abundance. \n\t26.\n\nHe caused the east wind to blow in the heavens, and by his power he led out the south wind; \n\t27.\n\nhe rained flesh upon them like dust, winged birds like the sand of the seas; \n\t28.\n\nhe let them fall within their camp, all around their dwellings. \n\t29.\n\nAnd they ate and were well filled, for he gave them what they craved. \n\t30.\n\nBut before they had satisfied their craving, while the food was still in their mouths, \n\t31.\n\nthe anger of God rose against them and he killed the strongest of them, and laid low the flower of Israel. \n\t32.\n\nIn spite of all this they still sinned; they did not believe in his wonders. \n\t33.\n\nSo he made their days vanish like a breath, and their years in terror. \n\t34.\n\nWhen he killed them, they sought for him; they repented and sought God earnestly. \n\t35.\n\nThey remembered that God was their rock, the Most High God their redeemer. \n\t36.\n\nBut they flattered him with their mouths; they lied to him with their tongues. \n\t37.\n\nTheir heart was not steadfast toward him; they were not true to his covenant. \n\t38.\n\nYet he, being compassionate, forgave their iniquity, and did not destroy them; often he restrained his anger, and did not stir up all his wrath. \n\t39.\n\nHe remembered that they were but flesh, a wind that passes and does not come again. \n\t40.\n\nHow often they rebelled against him in the wilderness and grieved him in the desert! \n\t41.\n\nThey tested God again and again, and provoked the Holy One of Israel. \n\t42.\n\nThey did not keep in mind his power, or the day when he redeemed them from the foe; \n\t43.\n\nwhen he displayed his signs in Egypt, and his miracles in the fields of Zoan. \n\t44.\n\nHe turned their rivers to blood, so that they could not drink of their streams. \n\t45.\n\nHe sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them, and frogs, which destroyed them. \n\t46.\n\nHe gave their crops to the caterpillar, and the fruit of their labor to the locust. \n\t47.\n\nHe destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycamores with frost. \n\t48.\n\nHe gave over their cattle to the hail, and their flocks to thunderbolts. \n\t49.\n\nHe let loose on them his fierce anger, wrath, indignation, and distress, a company of destroying angels. \n\t50.\n\nHe made a path for his anger; he did not spare them from death, but gave their lives over to the plague. \n\t51.\n\nHe struck all the firstborn in Egypt, the first issue of their strength in the tents of Ham. \n\t52.\n\nThen he led out his people like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock. \n\t53.\n\nHe led them in safety, so that they were not afraid; but the sea overwhelmed their enemies. \n\t54.\n\nAnd he brought them to his holy hill, to the mountain that his right hand had won. \n\t55.\n\nHe drove out nations before them; he apportioned them for a possession and settled the tribes of Israel in their tents. \n\t56.\n\nYet they tested the Most High God, and rebelled against him. They did not observe his decrees, \n\t57.\n\nbut turned away and were faithless like their ancestors; they twisted like a treacherous bow. \n\t58.\n\nFor they provoked him to anger with their high places; they moved him to jealousy with their idols. \n\t59.\n\nWhen God heard, he was full of wrath, and he utterly rejected Israel. \n\t60.\n\nHe abandoned his dwelling at Shiloh, the tent where he dwelt among mortals, \n\t61.\n\nand delivered his power to captivity, his glory to the hand of the foe. \n\t62.\n\nHe gave his people to the sword, and vented his wrath on his heritage. \n\t63.\n\nFire devoured their young men, and their girls had no marriage song. \n\t64.\n\nTheir priests fell by the sword, and their widows made no lamentation. \n\t65.\n\nThen the Lord awoke as from sleep, like a warrior shouting because of wine. \n\t66.\n\nHe put his adversaries to rout; he put them to everlasting disgrace. \n\t67.\n\nHe rejected the tent of Joseph, he did not choose the tribe of Ephraim; \n\t68.\n\nbut he chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion, which he loves. \n\t69.\n\nHe built his sanctuary like the high heavens, like the earth, which he has founded forever. \n\t70.\n\nHe chose his servant David, and took him from the sheepfolds; \n\t71.\n\nfrom tending the nursing ewes he brought him to be the shepherd of his people Jacob, of Israel, his inheritance. \n\t72.\n\nWith upright heart he tended them, and guided them with skillful hand."

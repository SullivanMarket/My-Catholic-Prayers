  "content": "THE LITANY OF FORGIVENESS\nLord Jesus Christ, you said:\nBlessed are the poor in spirit,\nfor theirs is the Kingdom of heaven.\nYet we are preoccupied with money and worldly goods\nand put our trust in what we possess\nrather than in your care for us.\nHave mercy on us,\nO Lord, have mercy on us.\nLord Jesus Christ, you said:\nBlessed are the gentle,\nfor they shall inherit the earth.\nYet we are so concerned about our own rights and self-interest\nand so little concerned about serving others.\nHave mercy on us,\nO Lord, have mercy on us.\nLord Jesus Christ, you said:\nBlessed are those who mourn,\nfor they shall be comforted.\nYet we are impatient under our burdens\nand unconcerned about the burdens of others.\nHave mercy on us,\nO Lord, have mercy on us.\nLord Jesus Christ, you said:\nBlessed are they who hunger and thirst for righteousness,\nfor they shall have their fill.\nYet we do not thirst for you,\nthe fountain of all holiness,\nand we are satisfied with half-measures and mediocrity.\nHave mercy on us,\nO Lord, have mercy on us.\nLord Jesus Christ, you said:\nBlessed are the merciful for they shall receive\nmercy. Yet we are so quick to condemn, so slow to forgive.\nHave mercy on us,\nO Lord, have mercy on us.\nLord Jesus Christ, you said:\nBlessed are the pure of heart,\nfor they shall see God.\nYet we have often regarded persons\ncreated in your image as objects of our own lusts\nand can not raise our eyes to you.\nHave mercy on us,\nO Lord, have mercy on us.\nLord Jesus Christ, you said:\nBlessed are the peacemakers,\nfor they shall be called the children of God.\nYet we are so often ruthless with each other,\nand our homes and our world are full of discord and resentments.\nHave mercy on us,\nO Lord, have mercy on us.\nLord, Jesus Christ. you said:\nBlessed are those who suffer persecution for holiness' sake,\nfor the Kingdom of God is theirs.\nYet we suffer no opposition because we have been ashamed of you,\nour Crucified Savior,\nand have lived worldly compromises of your Gospel.\nHave mercy on us,\nO Lord, have mercy on us."

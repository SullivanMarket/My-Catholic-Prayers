Amen.\n\nO Fourteen Holy Helpers, select friends of God, I honor thee as mighty intercessors, and come with filial confidence to thee in my needs, for the relief of which I have undertaken to make in this novena.  Help me by thy intercession to placate God’s divine and just wrath, which I have provoked by my many sins, and aid me in amending my life and doing penance.  Because you persevered till death, you gained the crown of eternal life.  Remember the dangers that surround us in this vale of tears, and intercede for us in all our needs and adversities.

Amen.\n\nIntro Prayer\n\nJesus, Mary, and Joseph, we give you our hearts and our souls.\nPray the Glory Be 3 times in thanksgiving to God for having exalted St. Joseph to a position of such exceptional dignity.\nOffering\nO Glorious Patriarch St. Joseph, we humbly prostrate ourselves before you. We beg the Lord Jesus, your Immaculate Spouse the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all the Angels and Saints in the Heavenly Court to join us in this devotion.  We offer you this precious cloak while pledging our sincerest faith and devotion. We promise to do all in our power to honor you throughout our lifetime to prove our love for you.  Help us, St. Joseph. Assist us now and throughout our lifetimes, but especially at the moment of our deaths, as you were assisted by Jesus and Mary, that we may join you one day in Heaven and there honor you for all eternity. Amen.  O Glorious Patriarch St. Joseph, prostrate before you and your Divine Son Jesus, we offer you with heartfelt devotion this precious treasury of prayers, being ever mindful of the numerous virtues which adorned your sacred person.  In you, O Glorious Patriarch, was fulfilled the dream of your precursor the first Joseph, who indeed seemed to have been sent by God to prepare the way for your presence on this earth.  In fact, not only were you surrounded by the shining splendor of the rays of the Divine Sun, Jesus, but you were splendidly reflected in the brilliant light of the mystic moon, the Blessed Virgin Mary.  O Glorious Patriarch, if the example of the ancient Jacob, who personally went to congratulate his favorite son, who was exalted on the throne of Egypt, served to bring all his progeny there, should not the example of Jesus and Mary, who honored you with their greatest respect and trust, serve to bring us, your devoted servants, to present you with this precious cloak in your honor.  Grant, O great St. Joseph, that the Almighty God may turn a benevolent glance toward us.  As the ancient Joseph did not reject his guilty and cruel brothers, but rather accepted them with love and protected and saved them from hunger and death, we beseech you, O Glorious Patriarch, through your intercession, grant that the Lord may never abandon us in this exiled valley of sorrows. Grant that He may always number us among your devoted servants who live serenely under the patronage of your Holy Cloak.  Grant that we may live always within the protection of this patronage every day of our lives and particularly at that moment when we draw our dying breath.  Prayers  I. Hail, O Glorious St. Joseph, you who are entrusted with the priceless treasures of Heaven and earth and foster-father of Him who nourishes all the creatures of the universe.  You are, after Mary, the Saint most worthy of our love and devotion.  You alone, above all the Saints, were chosen for that supreme honor of rearing, guiding, nourishing, and even embracing the Messiah, whom so many kings and prophets would have so desired to behold.  St. Joseph, save our souls and obtain for us from the Divine Mercy of God that petition for which we humbly pray. And for the Holy Souls in Purgatory, grant a great comfort from their pain.  Glory Be x3  II. O powerful St. Joseph, you were proclaimed the Patron of the Universal Church; therefore, we invoke you, above all the other Saints, as the greatest protector of the afflicted, and we offer countless blessings to your most generous heart, always ready to help in any need.  To you, O Glorious St. Joseph, come the widows, the orphans, the abandoned, the afflicted, the oppressed. There is no sorrow, heartache, or anguish which you have not consoled.  Deign, we beseech you, to use on our behalf those gifts which God has given you, until we, too, shall be granted the answer to our petition. And you, Holy Souls in Purgatory, pray to St. Joseph for us.  Glory Be x3  III. Countless are those who have prayed to you before us and have received comfort and peace, graces and favors. Our hearts, so sad and sorrowful, cannot find rest in the midst of this trial which besets us.  O Glorious St. Joseph, you know all our needs even before we set them forth in prayer.  You know how important this petition is for us. We prostrate ourselves before you as we sigh under the heavy weight of the problem which confronts us.  There is no human heart in which we can confide our sorrow; and even if we should find a compassionate creature who would be willing to assist us, still he would be unable to help us.  Only you can help us in our sorrow, St. Joseph, and we beg you to hear our plea. (mention request here…)  Has not St. Teresa left it written in her Dialogues that the world may always know, Whatever you ask of St. Joseph, you shall receive?  O St. Joseph, comforter of the afflicted, have pity on our sorrow and pity on those Poor Souls who place so much hope in you.  Glory Be x3  IV. O Sublime Patriarch St. Joseph, because of your perfect obedience to God, you may intercede for us.  For your holy life full of grace and merit, hear our prayer.  For your most sweet name, help us. For your most holy tears, comfort us.  For your seven sorrows, intercede for us. For your seven joys, console us.  From all harm of body and soul, deliver us. From all danger and disaster, save us.  Assist us with your powerful intercession and seek for us, through your power and mercy, all that is necessary for our salvation and particularly the favor of which we now stand in such great need.  Glory Be x3  V. O Glorious St. Joseph, countless are the graces and favors which you have obtained for afflicted souls.  Those who suffer illness of every nature, those who are oppressed, persecuted, betrayed, bereft of all human comfort, even those in need of their life bread—all who implore your powerful intercession are comforted in their affliction.  Do not permit, O dearest St. Joseph, that we alone be the only ones of all who have appealed to you, to be denied this petition which we so earnestly beg of you. Show your kindness and generosity even to us, that we may cry out in thanksgiving, Eternal glory to our Holy Patriarch St. Joseph, our great protector on earth and the defender of the Holy Souls in Purgatory.  Glory Be x3  VI. Eternal Father, Who art in Heaven, through the merits of Jesus and Mary, we beg You to grant our petition.  In the name of Jesus and Mary we prostrate ourselves before Your Divine Presence and we beseech You to accept our hopeful plea to persevere in our prayers that we may be numbered among the throngs of those who live under the patronage of St. Joseph.  Extend Your blessing on this precious treasury of prayers which we today offer to him as a pledge of our devotion.

St. Joseph, graciously accept us as your devoted servants. St. Joseph, we give ourselves to you; accept our pleas and hear our prayers. St. Joseph, do not abandon us at the hour of our death. Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, we give you our hearts and our souls.\nGlory Be x3\nInvocations\nI. Remember, O most chaste spouse of the Blessed Virgin Mary, our good protector St. Joseph, that never was it known that anyone who came to your protection and sought your intercession was left unaided.

Amen.\nII.

We beg the Lord Jesus, your Immaculate Spouse the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all the Angels and Saints in the Heavenly Court to join us in this devotion.  We offer you this precious cloak while pledging our sincerest faith and devotion. We promise to do all in our power to honor you throughout our lifetime to prove our love for you.  Help us, St. Joseph. Assist us now and throughout our lifetimes, but especially at the moment of our deaths, as you were assisted by Jesus and Mary, that we may join you one day in Heaven and there honor you for all eternity. Amen.  O Glorious Patriarch St. Joseph, prostrate before you and your Divine Son Jesus, we offer you with heartfelt devotion this precious treasury of prayers, being ever mindful of the numerous virtues which adorned your sacred person.  In you, O Glorious Patriarch, was fulfilled the dream of your precursor the first Joseph, who indeed seemed to have been sent by God to prepare the way for your presence on this earth.  In fact, not only were you surrounded by the shining splendor of the rays of the Divine Sun, Jesus, but you were splendidly reflected in the brilliant light of the mystic moon, the Blessed Virgin Mary.  O Glorious Patriarch, if the example of the ancient Jacob, who personally went to congratulate his favorite son, who was exalted on the throne of Egypt, served to bring all his progeny there, should not the example of Jesus and Mary, who honored you with their greatest respect and trust, serve to bring us, your devoted servants, to present you with this precious cloak in your honor.  Grant, O great St. Joseph, that the Almighty God may turn a benevolent glance toward us.  As the ancient Joseph did not reject his guilty and cruel brothers, but rather accepted them with love and protected and saved them from hunger and death, we beseech you, O Glorious Patriarch, through your intercession, grant that the Lord may never abandon us in this exiled valley of sorrows. Grant that He may always number us among your devoted servants who live serenely under the patronage of your Holy Cloak.  Grant that we may live always within the protection of this patronage every day of our lives and particularly at that moment when we draw our dying breath.  Prayers  I. Hail, O Glorious St. Joseph, you who are entrusted with the priceless treasures of Heaven and earth and foster-father of Him who nourishes all the creatures of the universe.  You are, after Mary, the Saint most worthy of our love and devotion.  You alone, above all the Saints, were chosen for that supreme honor of rearing, guiding, nourishing, and even embracing the Messiah, whom so many kings and prophets would have so desired to behold.  St. Joseph, save our souls and obtain for us from the Divine Mercy of God that petition for which we humbly pray. And for the Holy Souls in Purgatory, grant a great comfort from their pain.  Glory Be x3  II. O powerful St. Joseph, you were proclaimed the Patron of the Universal Church; therefore, we invoke you, above all the other Saints, as the greatest protector of the afflicted, and we offer countless blessings to your most generous heart, always ready to help in any need.  To you, O Glorious St. Joseph, come the widows, the orphans, the abandoned, the afflicted, the oppressed. There is no sorrow, heartache, or anguish which you have not consoled.  Deign, we beseech you, to use on our behalf those gifts which God has given you, until we, too, shall be granted the answer to our petition. And you, Holy Souls in Purgatory, pray to St. Joseph for us.  Glory Be x3  III. Countless are those who have prayed to you before us and have received comfort and peace, graces and favors. Our hearts, so sad and sorrowful, cannot find rest in the midst of this trial which besets us.  O Glorious St. Joseph, you know all our needs even before we set them forth in prayer.  You know how important this petition is for us. We prostrate ourselves before you as we sigh under the heavy weight of the problem which confronts us.  There is no human heart in which we can confide our sorrow; and even if we should find a compassionate creature who would be willing to assist us, still he would be unable to help us.  Only you can help us in our sorrow, St. Joseph, and we beg you to hear our plea. (mention request here…)  Has not St. Teresa left it written in her Dialogues that the world may always know, Whatever you ask of St. Joseph, you shall receive?

Amen.\n\nIntro Prayer\n\nJesus, Mary, and Joseph, we give you our hearts and our souls.\nPray the Glory Be 3 times in thanksgiving to God for having exalted St. Joseph to a position of such exceptional dignity.\nOffering\nO Glorious Patriarch St. Joseph, we humbly prostrate ourselves before you. We beg the Lord Jesus, your Immaculate Spouse the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all the Angels and Saints in the Heavenly Court to join us in this devotion.  We offer you this precious cloak while pledging our sincerest faith and devotion. We promise to do all in our power to honor you throughout our lifetime to prove our love for you.  Help us, St. Joseph. Assist us now and throughout our lifetimes, but especially at the moment of our deaths, as you were assisted by Jesus and Mary, that we may join you one day in Heaven and there honor you for all eternity. Amen.  O Glorious Patriarch St. Joseph, prostrate before you and your Divine Son Jesus, we offer you with heartfelt devotion this precious treasury of prayers, being ever mindful of the numerous virtues which adorned your sacred person.  In you, O Glorious Patriarch, was fulfilled the dream of your precursor the first Joseph, who indeed seemed to have been sent by God to prepare the way for your presence on this earth.  In fact, not only were you surrounded by the shining splendor of the rays of the Divine Sun, Jesus, but you were splendidly reflected in the brilliant light of the mystic moon, the Blessed Virgin Mary.  O Glorious Patriarch, if the example of the ancient Jacob, who personally went to congratulate his favorite son, who was exalted on the throne of Egypt, served to bring all his progeny there, should not the example of Jesus and Mary, who honored you with their greatest respect and trust, serve to bring us, your devoted servants, to present you with this precious cloak in your honor.  Grant, O great St. Joseph, that the Almighty God may turn a benevolent glance toward us.  As the ancient Joseph did not reject his guilty and cruel brothers, but rather accepted them with love and protected and saved them from hunger and death, we beseech you, O Glorious Patriarch, through your intercession, grant that the Lord may never abandon us in this exiled valley of sorrows. Grant that He may always number us among your devoted servants who live serenely under the patronage of your Holy Cloak.  Grant that we may live always within the protection of this patronage every day of our lives and particularly at that moment when we draw our dying breath.  Prayers  I. Hail, O Glorious St. Joseph, you who are entrusted with the priceless treasures of Heaven and earth and foster-father of Him who nourishes all the creatures of the universe.  You are, after Mary, the Saint most worthy of our love and devotion.  You alone, above all the Saints, were chosen for that supreme honor of rearing, guiding, nourishing, and even embracing the Messiah, whom so many kings and prophets would have so desired to behold.  St. Joseph, save our souls and obtain for us from the Divine Mercy of God that petition for which we humbly pray. And for the Holy Souls in Purgatory, grant a great comfort from their pain.  Glory Be x3  II. O powerful St. Joseph, you were proclaimed the Patron of the Universal Church; therefore, we invoke you, above all the other Saints, as the greatest protector of the afflicted, and we offer countless blessings to your most generous heart, always ready to help in any need.  To you, O Glorious St. Joseph, come the widows, the orphans, the abandoned, the afflicted, the oppressed. There is no sorrow, heartache, or anguish which you have not consoled.  Deign, we beseech you, to use on our behalf those gifts which God has given you, until we, too, shall be granted the answer to our petition. And you, Holy Souls in Purgatory, pray to St. Joseph for us.  Glory Be x3  III. Countless are those who have prayed to you before us and have received comfort and peace, graces and favors. Our hearts, so sad and sorrowful, cannot find rest in the midst of this trial which besets us.  O Glorious St. Joseph, you know all our needs even before we set them forth in prayer.  You know how important this petition is for us. We prostrate ourselves before you as we sigh under the heavy weight of the problem which confronts us.  There is no human heart in which we can confide our sorrow; and even if we should find a compassionate creature who would be willing to assist us, still he would be unable to help us.  Only you can help us in our sorrow, St. Joseph, and we beg you to hear our plea. (mention request here…)  Has not St. Teresa left it written in her Dialogues that the world may always know, Whatever you ask of St. Joseph, you shall receive?  O St. Joseph, comforter of the afflicted, have pity on our sorrow and pity on those Poor Souls who place so much hope in you.  Glory Be x3  IV. O Sublime Patriarch St. Joseph, because of your perfect obedience to God, you may intercede for us.  For your holy life full of grace and merit, hear our prayer.  For your most sweet name, help us. For your most holy tears, comfort us.  For your seven sorrows, intercede for us. For your seven joys, console us.  From all harm of body and soul, deliver us. From all danger and disaster, save us.  Assist us with your powerful intercession and seek for us, through your power and mercy, all that is necessary for our salvation and particularly the favor of which we now stand in such great need.  Glory Be x3  V. O Glorious St. Joseph, countless are the graces and favors which you have obtained for afflicted souls.  Those who suffer illness of every nature, those who are oppressed, persecuted, betrayed, bereft of all human comfort, even those in need of their life bread—all who implore your powerful intercession are comforted in their affliction.  Do not permit, O dearest St. Joseph, that we alone be the only ones of all who have appealed to you, to be denied this petition which we so earnestly beg of you. Show your kindness and generosity even to us, that we may cry out in thanksgiving, Eternal glory to our Holy Patriarch St. Joseph, our great protector on earth and the defender of the Holy Souls in Purgatory.  Glory Be x3  VI. Eternal Father, Who art in Heaven, through the merits of Jesus and Mary, we beg You to grant our petition.  In the name of Jesus and Mary we prostrate ourselves before Your Divine Presence and we beseech You to accept our hopeful plea to persevere in our prayers that we may be numbered among the throngs of those who live under the patronage of St. Joseph.  Extend Your blessing on this precious treasury of prayers which we today offer to him as a pledge of our devotion.

Assist us now and throughout our lifetimes, but especially at the moment of our deaths, as you were assisted by Jesus and Mary, that we may join you one day in Heaven and there honor you for all eternity. Amen.  O Glorious Patriarch St. Joseph, prostrate before you and your Divine Son Jesus, we offer you with heartfelt devotion this precious treasury of prayers, being ever mindful of the numerous virtues which adorned your sacred person.  In you, O Glorious Patriarch, was fulfilled the dream of your precursor the first Joseph, who indeed seemed to have been sent by God to prepare the way for your presence on this earth.  In fact, not only were you surrounded by the shining splendor of the rays of the Divine Sun, Jesus, but you were splendidly reflected in the brilliant light of the mystic moon, the Blessed Virgin Mary.  O Glorious Patriarch, if the example of the ancient Jacob, who personally went to congratulate his favorite son, who was exalted on the throne of Egypt, served to bring all his progeny there, should not the example of Jesus and Mary, who honored you with their greatest respect and trust, serve to bring us, your devoted servants, to present you with this precious cloak in your honor.  Grant, O great St. Joseph, that the Almighty God may turn a benevolent glance toward us.  As the ancient Joseph did not reject his guilty and cruel brothers, but rather accepted them with love and protected and saved them from hunger and death, we beseech you, O Glorious Patriarch, through your intercession, grant that the Lord may never abandon us in this exiled valley of sorrows. Grant that He may always number us among your devoted servants who live serenely under the patronage of your Holy Cloak.  Grant that we may live always within the protection of this patronage every day of our lives and particularly at that moment when we draw our dying breath.  Prayers  I. Hail, O Glorious St. Joseph, you who are entrusted with the priceless treasures of Heaven and earth and foster-father of Him who nourishes all the creatures of the universe.  You are, after Mary, the Saint most worthy of our love and devotion.  You alone, above all the Saints, were chosen for that supreme honor of rearing, guiding, nourishing, and even embracing the Messiah, whom so many kings and prophets would have so desired to behold.  St. Joseph, save our souls and obtain for us from the Divine Mercy of God that petition for which we humbly pray. And for the Holy Souls in Purgatory, grant a great comfort from their pain.  Glory Be x3  II. O powerful St. Joseph, you were proclaimed the Patron of the Universal Church; therefore, we invoke you, above all the other Saints, as the greatest protector of the afflicted, and we offer countless blessings to your most generous heart, always ready to help in any need.  To you, O Glorious St. Joseph, come the widows, the orphans, the abandoned, the afflicted, the oppressed. There is no sorrow, heartache, or anguish which you have not consoled.  Deign, we beseech you, to use on our behalf those gifts which God has given you, until we, too, shall be granted the answer to our petition. And you, Holy Souls in Purgatory, pray to St. Joseph for us.  Glory Be x3  III. Countless are those who have prayed to you before us and have received comfort and peace, graces and favors. Our hearts, so sad and sorrowful, cannot find rest in the midst of this trial which besets us.  O Glorious St. Joseph, you know all our needs even before we set them forth in prayer.  You know how important this petition is for us. We prostrate ourselves before you as we sigh under the heavy weight of the problem which confronts us.  There is no human heart in which we can confide our sorrow; and even if we should find a compassionate creature who would be willing to assist us, still he would be unable to help us.  Only you can help us in our sorrow, St. Joseph, and we beg you to hear our plea. (mention request here…)  Has not St. Teresa left it written in her Dialogues that the world may always know, Whatever you ask of St. Joseph, you shall receive?  O St. Joseph, comforter of the afflicted, have pity on our sorrow and pity on those Poor Souls who place so much hope in you.  Glory Be x3  IV. O Sublime Patriarch St. Joseph, because of your perfect obedience to God, you may intercede for us.  For your holy life full of grace and merit, hear our prayer.  For your most sweet name, help us. For your most holy tears, comfort us.  For your seven sorrows, intercede for us. For your seven joys, console us.  From all harm of body and soul, deliver us. From all danger and disaster, save us.  Assist us with your powerful intercession and seek for us, through your power and mercy, all that is necessary for our salvation and particularly the favor of which we now stand in such great need.  Glory Be x3  V. O Glorious St. Joseph, countless are the graces and favors which you have obtained for afflicted souls.  Those who suffer illness of every nature, those who are oppressed, persecuted, betrayed, bereft of all human comfort, even those in need of their life bread—all who implore your powerful intercession are comforted in their affliction.  Do not permit, O dearest St. Joseph, that we alone be the only ones of all who have appealed to you, to be denied this petition which we so earnestly beg of you. Show your kindness and generosity even to us, that we may cry out in thanksgiving, Eternal glory to our Holy Patriarch St. Joseph, our great protector on earth and the defender of the Holy Souls in Purgatory.  Glory Be x3  VI. Eternal Father, Who art in Heaven, through the merits of Jesus and Mary, we beg You to grant our petition.  In the name of Jesus and Mary we prostrate ourselves before Your Divine Presence and we beseech You to accept our hopeful plea to persevere in our prayers that we may be numbered among the throngs of those who live under the patronage of St. Joseph.  Extend Your blessing on this precious treasury of prayers which we today offer to him as a pledge of our devotion.

We beg the Lord Jesus, your Immaculate Spouse the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all the Angels and Saints in the Heavenly Court to join us in this devotion.  We offer you this precious cloak while pledging our sincerest faith and devotion. We promise to do all in our power to honor you throughout our lifetime to prove our love for you.  Help us, St. Joseph. Assist us now and throughout our lifetimes, but especially at the moment of our deaths, as you were assisted by Jesus and Mary, that we may join you one day in Heaven and there honor you for all eternity. Amen.  O Glorious Patriarch St. Joseph, prostrate before you and your Divine Son Jesus, we offer you with heartfelt devotion this precious treasury of prayers, being ever mindful of the numerous virtues which adorned your sacred person.  In you, O Glorious Patriarch, was fulfilled the dream of your precursor the first Joseph, who indeed seemed to have been sent by God to prepare the way for your presence on this earth.  In fact, not only were you surrounded by the shining splendor of the rays of the Divine Sun, Jesus, but you were splendidly reflected in the brilliant light of the mystic moon, the Blessed Virgin Mary.  O Glorious Patriarch, if the example of the ancient Jacob, who personally went to congratulate his favorite son, who was exalted on the throne of Egypt, served to bring all his progeny there, should not the example of Jesus and Mary, who honored you with their greatest respect and trust, serve to bring us, your devoted servants, to present you with this precious cloak in your honor.  Grant, O great St. Joseph, that the Almighty God may turn a benevolent glance toward us.  As the ancient Joseph did not reject his guilty and cruel brothers, but rather accepted them with love and protected and saved them from hunger and death, we beseech you, O Glorious Patriarch, through your intercession, grant that the Lord may never abandon us in this exiled valley of sorrows. Grant that He may always number us among your devoted servants who live serenely under the patronage of your Holy Cloak.  Grant that we may live always within the protection of this patronage every day of our lives and particularly at that moment when we draw our dying breath.  Prayers  I. Hail, O Glorious St. Joseph, you who are entrusted with the priceless treasures of Heaven and earth and foster-father of Him who nourishes all the creatures of the universe.  You are, after Mary, the Saint most worthy of our love and devotion.  You alone, above all the Saints, were chosen for that supreme honor of rearing, guiding, nourishing, and even embracing the Messiah, whom so many kings and prophets would have so desired to behold.  St. Joseph, save our souls and obtain for us from the Divine Mercy of God that petition for which we humbly pray. And for the Holy Souls in Purgatory, grant a great comfort from their pain.  Glory Be x3  II. O powerful St. Joseph, you were proclaimed the Patron of the Universal Church; therefore, we invoke you, above all the other Saints, as the greatest protector of the afflicted, and we offer countless blessings to your most generous heart, always ready to help in any need.  To you, O Glorious St. Joseph, come the widows, the orphans, the abandoned, the afflicted, the oppressed. There is no sorrow, heartache, or anguish which you have not consoled.  Deign, we beseech you, to use on our behalf those gifts which God has given you, until we, too, shall be granted the answer to our petition. And you, Holy Souls in Purgatory, pray to St. Joseph for us.  Glory Be x3  III. Countless are those who have prayed to you before us and have received comfort and peace, graces and favors. Our hearts, so sad and sorrowful, cannot find rest in the midst of this trial which besets us.  O Glorious St. Joseph, you know all our needs even before we set them forth in prayer.  You know how important this petition is for us. We prostrate ourselves before you as we sigh under the heavy weight of the problem which confronts us.  There is no human heart in which we can confide our sorrow; and even if we should find a compassionate creature who would be willing to assist us, still he would be unable to help us.  Only you can help us in our sorrow, St. Joseph, and we beg you to hear our plea. (mention request here…)  Has not St. Teresa left it written in her Dialogues that the world may always know, Whatever you ask of St. Joseph, you shall receive?  O St. Joseph, comforter of the afflicted, have pity on our sorrow and pity on those Poor Souls who place so much hope in you.  Glory Be x3  IV. O Sublime Patriarch St. Joseph, because of your perfect obedience to God, you may intercede for us.  For your holy life full of grace and merit, hear our prayer.  For your most sweet name, help us. For your most holy tears, comfort us.  For your seven sorrows, intercede for us. For your seven joys, console us.  From all harm of body and soul, deliver us. From all danger and disaster, save us.  Assist us with your powerful intercession and seek for us, through your power and mercy, all that is necessary for our salvation and particularly the favor of which we now stand in such great need.  Glory Be x3  V. O Glorious St. Joseph, countless are the graces and favors which you have obtained for afflicted souls.  Those who suffer illness of every nature, those who are oppressed, persecuted, betrayed, bereft of all human comfort, even those in need of their life bread—all who implore your powerful intercession are comforted in their affliction.  Do not permit, O dearest St. Joseph, that we alone be the only ones of all who have appealed to you, to be denied this petition which we so earnestly beg of you.

We beg the Lord Jesus, your Immaculate Spouse the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all the Angels and Saints in the Heavenly Court to join us in this devotion.  We offer you this precious cloak while pledging our sincerest faith and devotion. We promise to do all in our power to honor you throughout our lifetime to prove our love for you.  Help us, St. Joseph. Assist us now and throughout our lifetimes, but especially at the moment of our deaths, as you were assisted by Jesus and Mary, that we may join you one day in Heaven and there honor you for all eternity. Amen.  O Glorious Patriarch St. Joseph, prostrate before you and your Divine Son Jesus, we offer you with heartfelt devotion this precious treasury of prayers, being ever mindful of the numerous virtues which adorned your sacred person.  In you, O Glorious Patriarch, was fulfilled the dream of your precursor the first Joseph, who indeed seemed to have been sent by God to prepare the way for your presence on this earth.  In fact, not only were you surrounded by the shining splendor of the rays of the Divine Sun, Jesus, but you were splendidly reflected in the brilliant light of the mystic moon, the Blessed Virgin Mary.  O Glorious Patriarch, if the example of the ancient Jacob, who personally went to congratulate his favorite son, who was exalted on the throne of Egypt, served to bring all his progeny there, should not the example of Jesus and Mary, who honored you with their greatest respect and trust, serve to bring us, your devoted servants, to present you with this precious cloak in your honor.  Grant, O great St. Joseph, that the Almighty God may turn a benevolent glance toward us.  As the ancient Joseph did not reject his guilty and cruel brothers, but rather accepted them with love and protected and saved them from hunger and death, we beseech you, O Glorious Patriarch, through your intercession, grant that the Lord may never abandon us in this exiled valley of sorrows. Grant that He may always number us among your devoted servants who live serenely under the patronage of your Holy Cloak.  Grant that we may live always within the protection of this patronage every day of our lives and particularly at that moment when we draw our dying breath.  Prayers  I. Hail, O Glorious St. Joseph, you who are entrusted with the priceless treasures of Heaven and earth and foster-father of Him who nourishes all the creatures of the universe.  You are, after Mary, the Saint most worthy of our love and devotion.  You alone, above all the Saints, were chosen for that supreme honor of rearing, guiding, nourishing, and even embracing the Messiah, whom so many kings and prophets would have so desired to behold.  St. Joseph, save our souls and obtain for us from the Divine Mercy of God that petition for which we humbly pray. And for the Holy Souls in Purgatory, grant a great comfort from their pain.  Glory Be x3  II. O powerful St. Joseph, you were proclaimed the Patron of the Universal Church; therefore, we invoke you, above all the other Saints, as the greatest protector of the afflicted, and we offer countless blessings to your most generous heart, always ready to help in any need.  To you, O Glorious St. Joseph, come the widows, the orphans, the abandoned, the afflicted, the oppressed. There is no sorrow, heartache, or anguish which you have not consoled.  Deign, we beseech you, to use on our behalf those gifts which God has given you, until we, too, shall be granted the answer to our petition. And you, Holy Souls in Purgatory, pray to St. Joseph for us.  Glory Be x3  III. Countless are those who have prayed to you before us and have received comfort and peace, graces and favors. Our hearts, so sad and sorrowful, cannot find rest in the midst of this trial which besets us.  O Glorious St. Joseph, you know all our needs even before we set them forth in prayer.  You know how important this petition is for us. We prostrate ourselves before you as we sigh under the heavy weight of the problem which confronts us.  There is no human heart in which we can confide our sorrow; and even if we should find a compassionate creature who would be willing to assist us, still he would be unable to help us.  Only you can help us in our sorrow, St. Joseph, and we beg you to hear our plea. (mention request here…)  Has not St. Teresa left it written in her Dialogues that the world may always know, Whatever you ask of St. Joseph, you shall receive?  O St. Joseph, comforter of the afflicted, have pity on our sorrow and pity on those Poor Souls who place so much hope in you.  Glory Be x3  IV. O Sublime Patriarch St. Joseph, because of your perfect obedience to God, you may intercede for us.  For your holy life full of grace and merit, hear our prayer.  For your most sweet name, help us. For your most holy tears, comfort us.  For your seven sorrows, intercede for us. For your seven joys, console us.  From all harm of body and soul, deliver us. From all danger and disaster, save us.  Assist us with your powerful intercession and seek for us, through your power and mercy, all that is necessary for our salvation and particularly the favor of which we now stand in such great need.  Glory Be x3  V. O Glorious St. Joseph, countless are the graces and favors which you have obtained for afflicted souls.  Those who suffer illness of every nature, those who are oppressed, persecuted, betrayed, bereft of all human comfort, even those in need of their life bread—all who implore your powerful intercession are comforted in their affliction.  Do not permit, O dearest St. Joseph, that we alone be the only ones of all who have appealed to you, to be denied this petition which we so earnestly beg of you. Show your kindness and generosity even to us, that we may cry out in thanksgiving, Eternal glory to our Holy Patriarch St. Joseph, our great protector on earth and the defender of the Holy Souls in Purgatory.  Glory Be x3  VI. Eternal Father, Who art in Heaven, through the merits of Jesus and Mary, we beg You to grant our petition.  In the name of Jesus and Mary we prostrate ourselves before Your Divine Presence and we beseech You to accept our hopeful plea to persevere in our prayers that we may be numbered among the throngs of those who live under the patronage of St. Joseph.  Extend Your blessing on this precious treasury of prayers which we today offer to him as a pledge of our devotion.

Grant that He may always number us among your devoted servants who live serenely under the patronage of your Holy Cloak.  Grant that we may live always within the protection of this patronage every day of our lives and particularly at that moment when we draw our dying breath.  Prayers  I. Hail, O Glorious St. Joseph, you who are entrusted with the priceless treasures of Heaven and earth and foster-father of Him who nourishes all the creatures of the universe.  You are, after Mary, the Saint most worthy of our love and devotion.  You alone, above all the Saints, were chosen for that supreme honor of rearing, guiding, nourishing, and even embracing the Messiah, whom so many kings and prophets would have so desired to behold.  St. Joseph, save our souls and obtain for us from the Divine Mercy of God that petition for which we humbly pray. And for the Holy Souls in Purgatory, grant a great comfort from their pain.  Glory Be x3  II. O powerful St. Joseph, you were proclaimed the Patron of the Universal Church; therefore, we invoke you, above all the other Saints, as the greatest protector of the afflicted, and we offer countless blessings to your most generous heart, always ready to help in any need.  To you, O Glorious St. Joseph, come the widows, the orphans, the abandoned, the afflicted, the oppressed. There is no sorrow, heartache, or anguish which you have not consoled.  Deign, we beseech you, to use on our behalf those gifts which God has given you, until we, too, shall be granted the answer to our petition. And you, Holy Souls in Purgatory, pray to St. Joseph for us.  Glory Be x3  III. Countless are those who have prayed to you before us and have received comfort and peace, graces and favors. Our hearts, so sad and sorrowful, cannot find rest in the midst of this trial which besets us.  O Glorious St. Joseph, you know all our needs even before we set them forth in prayer.  You know how important this petition is for us. We prostrate ourselves before you as we sigh under the heavy weight of the problem which confronts us.  There is no human heart in which we can confide our sorrow; and even if we should find a compassionate creature who would be willing to assist us, still he would be unable to help us.  Only you can help us in our sorrow, St. Joseph, and we beg you to hear our plea. (mention request here…)  Has not St. Teresa left it written in her Dialogues that the world may always know, Whatever you ask of St. Joseph, you shall receive?  O St. Joseph, comforter of the afflicted, have pity on our sorrow and pity on those Poor Souls who place so much hope in you.  Glory Be x3  IV. O Sublime Patriarch St. Joseph, because of your perfect obedience to God, you may intercede for us.  For your holy life full of grace and merit, hear our prayer.  For your most sweet name, help us. For your most holy tears, comfort us.  For your seven sorrows, intercede for us. For your seven joys, console us.  From all harm of body and soul, deliver us. From all danger and disaster, save us.  Assist us with your powerful intercession and seek for us, through your power and mercy, all that is necessary for our salvation and particularly the favor of which we now stand in such great need.  Glory Be x3  V. O Glorious St. Joseph, countless are the graces and favors which you have obtained for afflicted souls.  Those who suffer illness of every nature, those who are oppressed, persecuted, betrayed, bereft of all human comfort, even those in need of their life bread—all who implore your powerful intercession are comforted in their affliction.  Do not permit, O dearest St. Joseph, that we alone be the only ones of all who have appealed to you, to be denied this petition which we so earnestly beg of you. Show your kindness and generosity even to us, that we may cry out in thanksgiving, Eternal glory to our Holy Patriarch St. Joseph, our great protector on earth and the defender of the Holy Souls in Purgatory.  Glory Be x3  VI. Eternal Father, Who art in Heaven, through the merits of Jesus and Mary, we beg You to grant our petition.  In the name of Jesus and Mary we prostrate ourselves before Your Divine Presence and we beseech You to accept our hopeful plea to persevere in our prayers that we may be numbered among the throngs of those who live under the patronage of St. Joseph.

Amen.\n\nIntro Prayer\n\nJesus, Mary, and Joseph, we give you our hearts and our souls.\nPray the Glory Be 3 times in thanksgiving to God for having exalted St. Joseph to a position of such exceptional dignity.\nOffering\nO Glorious Patriarch St. Joseph, we humbly prostrate ourselves before you. We beg the Lord Jesus, your Immaculate Spouse the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all the Angels and Saints in the Heavenly Court to join us in this devotion.  We offer you this precious cloak while pledging our sincerest faith and devotion. We promise to do all in our power to honor you throughout our lifetime to prove our love for you.  Help us, St. Joseph. Assist us now and throughout our lifetimes, but especially at the moment of our deaths, as you were assisted by Jesus and Mary, that we may join you one day in Heaven and there honor you for all eternity. Amen.  O Glorious Patriarch St. Joseph, prostrate before you and your Divine Son Jesus, we offer you with heartfelt devotion this precious treasury of prayers, being ever mindful of the numerous virtues which adorned your sacred person.  In you, O Glorious Patriarch, was fulfilled the dream of your precursor the first Joseph, who indeed seemed to have been sent by God to prepare the way for your presence on this earth.  In fact, not only were you surrounded by the shining splendor of the rays of the Divine Sun, Jesus, but you were splendidly reflected in the brilliant light of the mystic moon, the Blessed Virgin Mary.  O Glorious Patriarch, if the example of the ancient Jacob, who personally went to congratulate his favorite son, who was exalted on the throne of Egypt, served to bring all his progeny there, should not the example of Jesus and Mary, who honored you with their greatest respect and trust, serve to bring us, your devoted servants, to present you with this precious cloak in your honor.  Grant, O great St. Joseph, that the Almighty God may turn a benevolent glance toward us.  As the ancient Joseph did not reject his guilty and cruel brothers, but rather accepted them with love and protected and saved them from hunger and death, we beseech you, O Glorious Patriarch, through your intercession, grant that the Lord may never abandon us in this exiled valley of sorrows. Grant that He may always number us among your devoted servants who live serenely under the patronage of your Holy Cloak.  Grant that we may live always within the protection of this patronage every day of our lives and particularly at that moment when we draw our dying breath.  Prayers  I. Hail, O Glorious St. Joseph, you who are entrusted with the priceless treasures of Heaven and earth and foster-father of Him who nourishes all the creatures of the universe.  You are, after Mary, the Saint most worthy of our love and devotion.  You alone, above all the Saints, were chosen for that supreme honor of rearing, guiding, nourishing, and even embracing the Messiah, whom so many kings and prophets would have so desired to behold.  St. Joseph, save our souls and obtain for us from the Divine Mercy of God that petition for which we humbly pray. And for the Holy Souls in Purgatory, grant a great comfort from their pain.  Glory Be x3  II. O powerful St. Joseph, you were proclaimed the Patron of the Universal Church; therefore, we invoke you, above all the other Saints, as the greatest protector of the afflicted, and we offer countless blessings to your most generous heart, always ready to help in any need.  To you, O Glorious St. Joseph, come the widows, the orphans, the abandoned, the afflicted, the oppressed. There is no sorrow, heartache, or anguish which you have not consoled.  Deign, we beseech you, to use on our behalf those gifts which God has given you, until we, too, shall be granted the answer to our petition. And you, Holy Souls in Purgatory, pray to St. Joseph for us.  Glory Be x3  III. Countless are those who have prayed to you before us and have received comfort and peace, graces and favors. Our hearts, so sad and sorrowful, cannot find rest in the midst of this trial which besets us.  O Glorious St. Joseph, you know all our needs even before we set them forth in prayer.  You know how important this petition is for us. We prostrate ourselves before you as we sigh under the heavy weight of the problem which confronts us.  There is no human heart in which we can confide our sorrow; and even if we should find a compassionate creature who would be willing to assist us, still he would be unable to help us.  Only you can help us in our sorrow, St. Joseph, and we beg you to hear our plea. (mention request here…)  Has not St. Teresa left it written in her Dialogues that the world may always know, Whatever you ask of St. Joseph, you shall receive?  O St. Joseph, comforter of the afflicted, have pity on our sorrow and pity on those Poor Souls who place so much hope in you.  Glory Be x3  IV. O Sublime Patriarch St. Joseph, because of your perfect obedience to God, you may intercede for us.  For your holy life full of grace and merit, hear our prayer.  For your most sweet name, help us. For your most holy tears, comfort us.  For your seven sorrows, intercede for us. For your seven joys, console us.  From all harm of body and soul, deliver us. From all danger and disaster, save us.  Assist us with your powerful intercession and seek for us, through your power and mercy, all that is necessary for our salvation and particularly the favor of which we now stand in such great need.  Glory Be x3  V. O Glorious St. Joseph, countless are the graces and favors which you have obtained for afflicted souls.  Those who suffer illness of every nature, those who are oppressed, persecuted, betrayed, bereft of all human comfort, even those in need of their life bread—all who implore your powerful intercession are comforted in their affliction.  Do not permit, O dearest St. Joseph, that we alone be the only ones of all who have appealed to you, to be denied this petition which we so earnestly beg of you. Show your kindness and generosity even to us, that we may cry out in thanksgiving, Eternal glory to our Holy Patriarch St. Joseph, our great protector on earth and the defender of the Holy Souls in Purgatory.  Glory Be x3  VI. Eternal Father, Who art in Heaven, through the merits of Jesus and Mary, we beg You to grant our petition.  In the name of Jesus and Mary we prostrate ourselves before Your Divine Presence and we beseech You to accept our hopeful plea to persevere in our prayers that we may be numbered among the throngs of those who live under the patronage of St. Joseph.  Extend Your blessing on this precious treasury of prayers which we today offer to him as a pledge of our devotion.

We beg the Lord Jesus, your Immaculate Spouse the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all the Angels and Saints in the Heavenly Court to join us in this devotion.  We offer you this precious cloak while pledging our sincerest faith and devotion. We promise to do all in our power to honor you throughout our lifetime to prove our love for you.  Help us, St. Joseph. Assist us now and throughout our lifetimes, but especially at the moment of our deaths, as you were assisted by Jesus and Mary, that we may join you one day in Heaven and there honor you for all eternity. Amen.  O Glorious Patriarch St. Joseph, prostrate before you and your Divine Son Jesus, we offer you with heartfelt devotion this precious treasury of prayers, being ever mindful of the numerous virtues which adorned your sacred person.  In you, O Glorious Patriarch, was fulfilled the dream of your precursor the first Joseph, who indeed seemed to have been sent by God to prepare the way for your presence on this earth.  In fact, not only were you surrounded by the shining splendor of the rays of the Divine Sun, Jesus, but you were splendidly reflected in the brilliant light of the mystic moon, the Blessed Virgin Mary.  O Glorious Patriarch, if the example of the ancient Jacob, who personally went to congratulate his favorite son, who was exalted on the throne of Egypt, served to bring all his progeny there, should not the example of Jesus and Mary, who honored you with their greatest respect and trust, serve to bring us, your devoted servants, to present you with this precious cloak in your honor.  Grant, O great St. Joseph, that the Almighty God may turn a benevolent glance toward us.  As the ancient Joseph did not reject his guilty and cruel brothers, but rather accepted them with love and protected and saved them from hunger and death, we beseech you, O Glorious Patriarch, through your intercession, grant that the Lord may never abandon us in this exiled valley of sorrows. Grant that He may always number us among your devoted servants who live serenely under the patronage of your Holy Cloak.  Grant that we may live always within the protection of this patronage every day of our lives and particularly at that moment when we draw our dying breath.  Prayers  I. Hail, O Glorious St. Joseph, you who are entrusted with the priceless treasures of Heaven and earth and foster-father of Him who nourishes all the creatures of the universe.  You are, after Mary, the Saint most worthy of our love and devotion.  You alone, above all the Saints, were chosen for that supreme honor of rearing, guiding, nourishing, and even embracing the Messiah, whom so many kings and prophets would have so desired to behold.  St. Joseph, save our souls and obtain for us from the Divine Mercy of God that petition for which we humbly pray. And for the Holy Souls in Purgatory, grant a great comfort from their pain.  Glory Be x3  II. O powerful St. Joseph, you were proclaimed the Patron of the Universal Church; therefore, we invoke you, above all the other Saints, as the greatest protector of the afflicted, and we offer countless blessings to your most generous heart, always ready to help in any need.  To you, O Glorious St. Joseph, come the widows, the orphans, the abandoned, the afflicted, the oppressed. There is no sorrow, heartache, or anguish which you have not consoled.  Deign, we beseech you, to use on our behalf those gifts which God has given you, until we, too, shall be granted the answer to our petition. And you, Holy Souls in Purgatory, pray to St. Joseph for us.  Glory Be x3  III. Countless are those who have prayed to you before us and have received comfort and peace, graces and favors. Our hearts, so sad and sorrowful, cannot find rest in the midst of this trial which besets us.  O Glorious St. Joseph, you know all our needs even before we set them forth in prayer.  You know how important this petition is for us. We prostrate ourselves before you as we sigh under the heavy weight of the problem which confronts us.  There is no human heart in which we can confide our sorrow; and even if we should find a compassionate creature who would be willing to assist us, still he would be unable to help us.  Only you can help us in our sorrow, St. Joseph, and we beg you to hear our plea. (mention request here…)  Has not St. Teresa left it written in her Dialogues that the world may always know, Whatever you ask of St. Joseph, you shall receive?  O St. Joseph, comforter of the afflicted, have pity on our sorrow and pity on those Poor Souls who place so much hope in you.  Glory Be x3  IV. O Sublime Patriarch St. Joseph, because of your perfect obedience to God, you may intercede for us.  For your holy life full of grace and merit, hear our prayer.  For your most sweet name, help us. For your most holy tears, comfort us.  For your seven sorrows, intercede for us. For your seven joys, console us.  From all harm of body and soul, deliver us. From all danger and disaster, save us.  Assist us with your powerful intercession and seek for us, through your power and mercy, all that is necessary for our salvation and particularly the favor of which we now stand in such great need.  Glory Be x3  V. O Glorious St. Joseph, countless are the graces and favors which you have obtained for afflicted souls.  Those who suffer illness of every nature, those who are oppressed, persecuted, betrayed, bereft of all human comfort, even those in need of their life bread—all who implore your powerful intercession are comforted in their affliction.  Do not permit, O dearest St. Joseph, that we alone be the only ones of all who have appealed to you, to be denied this petition which we so earnestly beg of you. Show your kindness and generosity even to us, that we may cry out in thanksgiving, Eternal glory to our Holy Patriarch St. Joseph, our great protector on earth and the defender of the Holy Souls in Purgatory.  Glory Be x3  VI. Eternal Father, Who art in Heaven, through the merits of Jesus and Mary, we beg You to grant our petition.  In the name of Jesus and Mary we prostrate ourselves before Your Divine Presence and we beseech You to accept our hopeful plea to persevere in our prayers that we may be numbered among the throngs of those who live under the patronage of St. Joseph.  Extend Your blessing on this precious treasury of prayers which we today offer to him as a pledge of our devotion.

You alone, above all the Saints, were chosen for that supreme honor of rearing, guiding, nourishing, and even embracing the Messiah, whom so many kings and prophets would have so desired to behold.  St. Joseph, save our souls and obtain for us from the Divine Mercy of God that petition for which we humbly pray. And for the Holy Souls in Purgatory, grant a great comfort from their pain.  Glory Be x3  II. O powerful St. Joseph, you were proclaimed the Patron of the Universal Church; therefore, we invoke you, above all the other Saints, as the greatest protector of the afflicted, and we offer countless blessings to your most generous heart, always ready to help in any need.  To you, O Glorious St. Joseph, come the widows, the orphans, the abandoned, the afflicted, the oppressed. There is no sorrow, heartache, or anguish which you have not consoled.  Deign, we beseech you, to use on our behalf those gifts which God has given you, until we, too, shall be granted the answer to our petition. And you, Holy Souls in Purgatory, pray to St. Joseph for us.  Glory Be x3  III. Countless are those who have prayed to you before us and have received comfort and peace, graces and favors. Our hearts, so sad and sorrowful, cannot find rest in the midst of this trial which besets us.  O Glorious St. Joseph, you know all our needs even before we set them forth in prayer.  You know how important this petition is for us. We prostrate ourselves before you as we sigh under the heavy weight of the problem which confronts us.  There is no human heart in which we can confide our sorrow; and even if we should find a compassionate creature who would be willing to assist us, still he would be unable to help us.  Only you can help us in our sorrow, St. Joseph, and we beg you to hear our plea. (mention request here…)  Has not St. Teresa left it written in her Dialogues that the world may always know, Whatever you ask of St. Joseph, you shall receive?  O St. Joseph, comforter of the afflicted, have pity on our sorrow and pity on those Poor Souls who place so much hope in you.  Glory Be x3  IV. O Sublime Patriarch St. Joseph, because of your perfect obedience to God, you may intercede for us.  For your holy life full of grace and merit, hear our prayer.  For your most sweet name, help us. For your most holy tears, comfort us.  For your seven sorrows, intercede for us. For your seven joys, console us.  From all harm of body and soul, deliver us. From all danger and disaster, save us.  Assist us with your powerful intercession and seek for us, through your power and mercy, all that is necessary for our salvation and particularly the favor of which we now stand in such great need.  Glory Be x3  V. O Glorious St. Joseph, countless are the graces and favors which you have obtained for afflicted souls.  Those who suffer illness of every nature, those who are oppressed, persecuted, betrayed, bereft of all human comfort, even those in need of their life bread—all who implore your powerful intercession are comforted in their affliction.  Do not permit, O dearest St. Joseph, that we alone be the only ones of all who have appealed to you, to be denied this petition which we so earnestly beg of you. Show your kindness and generosity even to us, that we may cry out in thanksgiving, Eternal glory to our Holy Patriarch St. Joseph, our great protector on earth and the defender of the Holy Souls in Purgatory.

We beg the Lord Jesus, your Immaculate Spouse the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all the Angels and Saints in the Heavenly Court to join us in this devotion.  We offer you this precious cloak while pledging our sincerest faith and devotion. We promise to do all in our power to honor you throughout our lifetime to prove our love for you.  Help us, St. Joseph. Assist us now and throughout our lifetimes, but especially at the moment of our deaths, as you were assisted by Jesus and Mary, that we may join you one day in Heaven and there honor you for all eternity. Amen.  O Glorious Patriarch St. Joseph, prostrate before you and your Divine Son Jesus, we offer you with heartfelt devotion this precious treasury of prayers, being ever mindful of the numerous virtues which adorned your sacred person.  In you, O Glorious Patriarch, was fulfilled the dream of your precursor the first Joseph, who indeed seemed to have been sent by God to prepare the way for your presence on this earth.  In fact, not only were you surrounded by the shining splendor of the rays of the Divine Sun, Jesus, but you were splendidly reflected in the brilliant light of the mystic moon, the Blessed Virgin Mary.  O Glorious Patriarch, if the example of the ancient Jacob, who personally went to congratulate his favorite son, who was exalted on the throne of Egypt, served to bring all his progeny there, should not the example of Jesus and Mary, who honored you with their greatest respect and trust, serve to bring us, your devoted servants, to present you with this precious cloak in your honor.  Grant, O great St. Joseph, that the Almighty God may turn a benevolent glance toward us.  As the ancient Joseph did not reject his guilty and cruel brothers, but rather accepted them with love and protected and saved them from hunger and death, we beseech you, O Glorious Patriarch, through your intercession, grant that the Lord may never abandon us in this exiled valley of sorrows. Grant that He may always number us among your devoted servants who live serenely under the patronage of your Holy Cloak.  Grant that we may live always within the protection of this patronage every day of our lives and particularly at that moment when we draw our dying breath.  Prayers  I. Hail, O Glorious St. Joseph, you who are entrusted with the priceless treasures of Heaven and earth and foster-father of Him who nourishes all the creatures of the universe.  You are, after Mary, the Saint most worthy of our love and devotion.  You alone, above all the Saints, were chosen for that supreme honor of rearing, guiding, nourishing, and even embracing the Messiah, whom so many kings and prophets would have so desired to behold.  St. Joseph, save our souls and obtain for us from the Divine Mercy of God that petition for which we humbly pray. And for the Holy Souls in Purgatory, grant a great comfort from their pain.  Glory Be x3  II. O powerful St. Joseph, you were proclaimed the Patron of the Universal Church; therefore, we invoke you, above all the other Saints, as the greatest protector of the afflicted, and we offer countless blessings to your most generous heart, always ready to help in any need.  To you, O Glorious St. Joseph, come the widows, the orphans, the abandoned, the afflicted, the oppressed. There is no sorrow, heartache, or anguish which you have not consoled.  Deign, we beseech you, to use on our behalf those gifts which God has given you, until we, too, shall be granted the answer to our petition. And you, Holy Souls in Purgatory, pray to St. Joseph for us.  Glory Be x3  III. Countless are those who have prayed to you before us and have received comfort and peace, graces and favors. Our hearts, so sad and sorrowful, cannot find rest in the midst of this trial which besets us.  O Glorious St. Joseph, you know all our needs even before we set them forth in prayer.  You know how important this petition is for us. We prostrate ourselves before you as we sigh under the heavy weight of the problem which confronts us.  There is no human heart in which we can confide our sorrow; and even if we should find a compassionate creature who would be willing to assist us, still he would be unable to help us.  Only you can help us in our sorrow, St. Joseph, and we beg you to hear our plea. (mention request here…)  Has not St. Teresa left it written in her Dialogues that the world may always know, Whatever you ask of St. Joseph, you shall receive?  O St. Joseph, comforter of the afflicted, have pity on our sorrow and pity on those Poor Souls who place so much hope in you.  Glory Be x3  IV. O Sublime Patriarch St. Joseph, because of your perfect obedience to God, you may intercede for us.  For your holy life full of grace and merit, hear our prayer.  For your most sweet name, help us. For your most holy tears, comfort us.  For your seven sorrows, intercede for us. For your seven joys, console us.  From all harm of body and soul, deliver us. From all danger and disaster, save us.  Assist us with your powerful intercession and seek for us, through your power and mercy, all that is necessary for our salvation and particularly the favor of which we now stand in such great need.  Glory Be x3  V. O Glorious St. Joseph, countless are the graces and favors which you have obtained for afflicted souls.  Those who suffer illness of every nature, those who are oppressed, persecuted, betrayed, bereft of all human comfort, even those in need of their life bread—all who implore your powerful intercession are comforted in their affliction.  Do not permit, O dearest St. Joseph, that we alone be the only ones of all who have appealed to you, to be denied this petition which we so earnestly beg of you. Show your kindness and generosity even to us, that we may cry out in thanksgiving, Eternal glory to our Holy Patriarch St. Joseph, our great protector on earth and the defender of the Holy Souls in Purgatory.  Glory Be x3  VI. Eternal Father, Who art in Heaven, through the merits of Jesus and Mary, we beg You to grant our petition.  In the name of Jesus and Mary we prostrate ourselves before Your Divine Presence and we beseech You to accept our hopeful plea to persevere in our prayers that we may be numbered among the throngs of those who live under the patronage of St. Joseph.  Extend Your blessing on this precious treasury of prayers which we today offer to him as a pledge of our devotion.

We beg the Lord Jesus, your Immaculate Spouse the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all the Angels and Saints in the Heavenly Court to join us in this devotion.  We offer you this precious cloak while pledging our sincerest faith and devotion. We promise to do all in our power to honor you throughout our lifetime to prove our love for you.  Help us, St. Joseph. Assist us now and throughout our lifetimes, but especially at the moment of our deaths, as you were assisted by Jesus and Mary, that we may join you one day in Heaven and there honor you for all eternity. Amen.  O Glorious Patriarch St. Joseph, prostrate before you and your Divine Son Jesus, we offer you with heartfelt devotion this precious treasury of prayers, being ever mindful of the numerous virtues which adorned your sacred person.  In you, O Glorious Patriarch, was fulfilled the dream of your precursor the first Joseph, who indeed seemed to have been sent by God to prepare the way for your presence on this earth.  In fact, not only were you surrounded by the shining splendor of the rays of the Divine Sun, Jesus, but you were splendidly reflected in the brilliant light of the mystic moon, the Blessed Virgin Mary.  O Glorious Patriarch, if the example of the ancient Jacob, who personally went to congratulate his favorite son, who was exalted on the throne of Egypt, served to bring all his progeny there, should not the example of Jesus and Mary, who honored you with their greatest respect and trust, serve to bring us, your devoted servants, to present you with this precious cloak in your honor.  Grant, O great St. Joseph, that the Almighty God may turn a benevolent glance toward us.  As the ancient Joseph did not reject his guilty and cruel brothers, but rather accepted them with love and protected and saved them from hunger and death, we beseech you, O Glorious Patriarch, through your intercession, grant that the Lord may never abandon us in this exiled valley of sorrows. Grant that He may always number us among your devoted servants who live serenely under the patronage of your Holy Cloak.  Grant that we may live always within the protection of this patronage every day of our lives and particularly at that moment when we draw our dying breath.  Prayers  I. Hail, O Glorious St. Joseph, you who are entrusted with the priceless treasures of Heaven and earth and foster-father of Him who nourishes all the creatures of the universe.  You are, after Mary, the Saint most worthy of our love and devotion.  You alone, above all the Saints, were chosen for that supreme honor of rearing, guiding, nourishing, and even embracing the Messiah, whom so many kings and prophets would have so desired to behold.  St. Joseph, save our souls and obtain for us from the Divine Mercy of God that petition for which we humbly pray. And for the Holy Souls in Purgatory, grant a great comfort from their pain.  Glory Be x3  II. O powerful St. Joseph, you were proclaimed the Patron of the Universal Church; therefore, we invoke you, above all the other Saints, as the greatest protector of the afflicted, and we offer countless blessings to your most generous heart, always ready to help in any need.  To you, O Glorious St. Joseph, come the widows, the orphans, the abandoned, the afflicted, the oppressed. There is no sorrow, heartache, or anguish which you have not consoled.  Deign, we beseech you, to use on our behalf those gifts which God has given you, until we, too, shall be granted the answer to our petition. And you, Holy Souls in Purgatory, pray to St. Joseph for us.  Glory Be x3  III. Countless are those who have prayed to you before us and have received comfort and peace, graces and favors. Our hearts, so sad and sorrowful, cannot find rest in the midst of this trial which besets us.  O Glorious St. Joseph, you know all our needs even before we set them forth in prayer.  You know how important this petition is for us. We prostrate ourselves before you as we sigh under the heavy weight of the problem which confronts us.  There is no human heart in which we can confide our sorrow; and even if we should find a compassionate creature who would be willing to assist us, still he would be unable to help us.  Only you can help us in our sorrow, St. Joseph, and we beg you to hear our plea. (mention request here…)  Has not St. Teresa left it written in her Dialogues that the world may always know, Whatever you ask of St. Joseph, you shall receive?  O St. Joseph, comforter of the afflicted, have pity on our sorrow and pity on those Poor Souls who place so much hope in you.  Glory Be x3  IV. O Sublime Patriarch St. Joseph, because of your perfect obedience to God, you may intercede for us.  For your holy life full of grace and merit, hear our prayer.  For your most sweet name, help us. For your most holy tears, comfort us.  For your seven sorrows, intercede for us. For your seven joys, console us.  From all harm of body and soul, deliver us. From all danger and disaster, save us.  Assist us with your powerful intercession and seek for us, through your power and mercy, all that is necessary for our salvation and particularly the favor of which we now stand in such great need.  Glory Be x3  V. O Glorious St. Joseph, countless are the graces and favors which you have obtained for afflicted souls.  Those who suffer illness of every nature, those who are oppressed, persecuted, betrayed, bereft of all human comfort, even those in need of their life bread—all who implore your powerful intercession are comforted in their affliction.  Do not permit, O dearest St. Joseph, that we alone be the only ones of all who have appealed to you, to be denied this petition which we so earnestly beg of you. Show your kindness and generosity even to us, that we may cry out in thanksgiving, Eternal glory to our Holy Patriarch St. Joseph, our great protector on earth and the defender of the Holy Souls in Purgatory.  Glory Be x3  VI. Eternal Father, Who art in Heaven, through the merits of Jesus and Mary, we beg You to grant our petition.  In the name of Jesus and Mary we prostrate ourselves before Your Divine Presence and we beseech You to accept our hopeful plea to persevere in our prayers that we may be numbered among the throngs of those who live under the patronage of St. Joseph.  Extend Your blessing on this precious treasury of prayers which we today offer to him as a pledge of our devotion.

O powerful St. Joseph, you were proclaimed the Patron of the Universal Church; therefore, we invoke you, above all the other Saints, as the greatest protector of the afflicted, and we offer countless blessings to your most generous heart, always ready to help in any need.  To you, O Glorious St. Joseph, come the widows, the orphans, the abandoned, the afflicted, the oppressed. There is no sorrow, heartache, or anguish which you have not consoled.  Deign, we beseech you, to use on our behalf those gifts which God has given you, until we, too, shall be granted the answer to our petition. And you, Holy Souls in Purgatory, pray to St. Joseph for us.  Glory Be x3  III. Countless are those who have prayed to you before us and have received comfort and peace, graces and favors. Our hearts, so sad and sorrowful, cannot find rest in the midst of this trial which besets us.  O Glorious St. Joseph, you know all our needs even before we set them forth in prayer.  You know how important this petition is for us. We prostrate ourselves before you as we sigh under the heavy weight of the problem which confronts us.  There is no human heart in which we can confide our sorrow; and even if we should find a compassionate creature who would be willing to assist us, still he would be unable to help us.  Only you can help us in our sorrow, St. Joseph, and we beg you to hear our plea. (mention request here…)  Has not St. Teresa left it written in her Dialogues that the world may always know, Whatever you ask of St. Joseph, you shall receive?

Assist us with your powerful intercession and seek for us, through your power and mercy, all that is necessary for our salvation and particularly the favor of which we now stand in such great need.  Glory Be x3  V. O Glorious St. Joseph, countless are the graces and favors which you have obtained for afflicted souls.  Those who suffer illness of every nature, those who are oppressed, persecuted, betrayed, bereft of all human comfort, even those in need of their life bread—all who implore your powerful intercession are comforted in their affliction.  Do not permit, O dearest St. Joseph, that we alone be the only ones of all who have appealed to you, to be denied this petition which we so earnestly beg of you. Show your kindness and generosity even to us, that we may cry out in thanksgiving, Eternal glory to our Holy Patriarch St. Joseph, our great protector on earth and the defender of the Holy Souls in Purgatory.

Amen.\n\nIntro Prayer\n\nJesus, Mary, and Joseph, we give you our hearts and our souls.\nPray the Glory Be 3 times in thanksgiving to God for having exalted St. Joseph to a position of such exceptional dignity.\nOffering\nO Glorious Patriarch St. Joseph, we humbly prostrate ourselves before you. We beg the Lord Jesus, your Immaculate Spouse the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all the Angels and Saints in the Heavenly Court to join us in this devotion.  We offer you this precious cloak while pledging our sincerest faith and devotion. We promise to do all in our power to honor you throughout our lifetime to prove our love for you.  Help us, St. Joseph. Assist us now and throughout our lifetimes, but especially at the moment of our deaths, as you were assisted by Jesus and Mary, that we may join you one day in Heaven and there honor you for all eternity. Amen.  O Glorious Patriarch St. Joseph, prostrate before you and your Divine Son Jesus, we offer you with heartfelt devotion this precious treasury of prayers, being ever mindful of the numerous virtues which adorned your sacred person.  In you, O Glorious Patriarch, was fulfilled the dream of your precursor the first Joseph, who indeed seemed to have been sent by God to prepare the way for your presence on this earth.  In fact, not only were you surrounded by the shining splendor of the rays of the Divine Sun, Jesus, but you were splendidly reflected in the brilliant light of the mystic moon, the Blessed Virgin Mary.  O Glorious Patriarch, if the example of the ancient Jacob, who personally went to congratulate his favorite son, who was exalted on the throne of Egypt, served to bring all his progeny there, should not the example of Jesus and Mary, who honored you with their greatest respect and trust, serve to bring us, your devoted servants, to present you with this precious cloak in your honor.  Grant, O great St. Joseph, that the Almighty God may turn a benevolent glance toward us.  As the ancient Joseph did not reject his guilty and cruel brothers, but rather accepted them with love and protected and saved them from hunger and death, we beseech you, O Glorious Patriarch, through your intercession, grant that the Lord may never abandon us in this exiled valley of sorrows. Grant that He may always number us among your devoted servants who live serenely under the patronage of your Holy Cloak.  Grant that we may live always within the protection of this patronage every day of our lives and particularly at that moment when we draw our dying breath.  Prayers  I. Hail, O Glorious St. Joseph, you who are entrusted with the priceless treasures of Heaven and earth and foster-father of Him who nourishes all the creatures of the universe.  You are, after Mary, the Saint most worthy of our love and devotion.  You alone, above all the Saints, were chosen for that supreme honor of rearing, guiding, nourishing, and even embracing the Messiah, whom so many kings and prophets would have so desired to behold.  St. Joseph, save our souls and obtain for us from the Divine Mercy of God that petition for which we humbly pray. And for the Holy Souls in Purgatory, grant a great comfort from their pain.

Amen.\n\nIntro Prayer\n\nFor the soul of Pope Francis, we pray, Eternal rest grant unto him, O Lord, and let perpetual light shine upon him. May his soul and the souls of all the faithful departed, through the mercy of God, rest in peace. Amen.\n(mention your request here)\nIn your hands, O Lord, we humbly entrust our brothers and sisters.\nIn this life you embraced them with your tender love; deliver them now from every evil and bid them eternal rest.\nThe old order has passed away; welcome them into paradise, where there will be no sorrow, no weeping or pain, but the fullness of peace and joy with your Son and the Holy Spirit forever and ever.\nAmen.\n\nConcluding Prayer\n\nPrayer Imploring for Holy Popes (adapted from Bp. Schneider’s prayer)\nKyrie Eleison!  Christe Eleison!  Kyrie Eleison! \nLord Jesus Christ, You are the Good Shepherd! With Your almighty hand You guide Your pilgrim Church through the storms of each age.\nAdorn the Holy See with a holy pope who neither fears the powerful of this world nor compromises with the spirit of the age, but preserves, strengthens, and defends the Catholic Faith unto the shedding of their blood, and observes, protects, and hands on the Tradition of the Church.\nO Lord, give us a holy pope who, inflamed with the zeal of the Apostles, proclaims to the whole world, Salvation is found in no other than in Jesus Christ. For there is no other name under heaven given to men by which they should be saved (see Acts 4:10-12).\nThrough an era of holy popes, may the Holy See—which is home to all who promote the Catholic and Apostolic Faith— always shine as the cathedra of truth for the whole world. Hear us, O Lord, and through the intercession of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, Mother of the Church, grant us a holy Pope, grant us many holy Popes! Have mercy on us and hear us! Amen.\nOur Father Hail Mary Glory Be",

You promised to hear our supplications, to dry our tears, and to give us consolation and relief.  Never has it been known that anyone who fled to your protection, implored your help, or sought your intercession, was left unaided. Inspired by this confidence, we fly to you, O Mary, ever-Virgin Mother of the true God! Though grieving under the weight of our sins, we come to prostrate ourselves before you. We fully trust that, standing beneath your shadow and protection, nothing will trouble or afflict us, nor do we need to fear illness or misfortune, or any other sorrow.  O Virgin of Guadalupe, you want to remain with us through your admirable Image, you who are our Mother, our health, and our life. Placing ourselves beneath your maternal gaze, and having recourse to you in all our necessities, we need do nothing more.  O Holy Mother of God, despise not our petitions, but in your mercy hear and answer us. Amen.\n\nDaily Prayer\n\nDearest Lady of Guadalupe, fruitful Mother of holiness, teach me your ways of gentleness and strength.

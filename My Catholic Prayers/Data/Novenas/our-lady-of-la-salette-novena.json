Amen.\n\nIntro Prayer\n\nO Virgin, in whom God did such great things because of Your abasements, obtain for me the grace to become little in my eyes, so that I may participate in Your ineffable secrets. \nI want to establish my soul in peace and in a detachment that will allow You to always manifest to me the will of God over me. \nMake my heart, dried up until now by the fire of passions, quench its thirst only at the pure sources of virtue and the sacraments.\n(mention request here…)\n\nDaily Prayer\n\nIn casting myself at thy feet, O loving Mother, to ask for these intentions, I cannot help remembering that thou camest on the mountain of La Salette, first of all, to remind me of my Christian duties. Therefore, there is no surer way for me to have my petition granted, than to return to the friendship of Jesus, by a sincere confession, and to endeavor with my whole strength to overcome my besetting sin. O Virgin Reconciler of sinners, obtain for me this most precious of all graces, for, with it all the rest shall be added unto me. The numberless miracles obtained by those who invoke thee under the title of Our Lady of La Salette, fill my heart with hope that my petition shall prove as fortunate as those addressed to thee, by so many other suppliants. Vouchsafe, O Mother, during each day of my novena, to instill into my heart some of the teaching of thy merciful Apparition.\n\nConcluding Prayer\n\nLord Jesus Christ, who, in Thy infinite mercy, didst send to us on the mountain of La Salette Thy ever glorious Mother in order to remind us of our Christian duties, grant that, moved by her tears and docile to her warnings, we may appease in this life Thy just anger by a sincere repentance, and that we may merit by our good works the grace to enjoy Thee eternally in heaven. Thou who livest and reignest world without end. Amen.\nOur Lady of La Salette, pray for us!",

My child, happy would I be, if my grief should inspire you with a heart-felt sorrow for your sins, and with a firm resolution to lead a better life! The land of your heart, as the Prophet says, is made desolate, because of your love for the world and its empty pleasures, because of your forgetfulness to meditate upon the most important truths of faith, i.e., your last end, together with the dreadful consequences, both here and hereafter, of your thoughtlessness. Retire into solitude and there my Son will speak to your heart, and will breathe into your soul the proper means of securing your salvation. O Mother, the motives that urge me to mingle my tears with thine are innumerable. I will not resist Jesus’ call any longer. Henceforth, with thy powerful aid, my thoughts, words and actions shall correspond to the wishes of the Divine Heart of Jesus.\n\nConcluding Prayer\n\nLord Jesus Christ, who, in Thy infinite mercy, didst send to us on the mountain of La Salette Thy ever glorious Mother in order to remind us of our Christian duties, grant that, moved by her tears and docile to her warnings, we may appease in this life Thy just anger by a sincere repentance, and that we may merit by our good works the grace to enjoy Thee eternally in heaven.

Why this stream of tears trickling down thy heavenly face and rolling over the golden cross on which they are burnt away as on a fire of Love? My child, was your soul never defiled by a mortal sin? Did you never scoff at my Son, thus crucifying anew your Saviour and your God? Is not the cross, that sacred emblem of salvation, scornfully banished from all the places where it used once to stand in honor? Such iniquities should be washed away by tears of blood! Strive, therefore, to appease my Son’s wrath and to mitigate His vengeance. Stand in fear that the Sacred Blood which once flowed on Calvary, should now fall revengefully upon your head, and the heads of those you hold dearest in this world! Dread that you should be deserted by God! Contemplate Jesus on His Cross. Humbly adore Him and pour forth your most heart-felt thanks at His feet. Remember that, with Him, there is a remedy for every evil. There is no virtue but finds in Him a perfect model. Bear His cross on your breast, but chiefly in your heart. And in return, heaven shall be your reward.\n\nConcluding Prayer\n\nLord Jesus Christ, who, in Thy infinite mercy, didst send to us on the mountain of La Salette Thy ever glorious Mother in order to remind us of our Christian duties, grant that, moved by her tears and docile to her warnings, we may appease in this life Thy just anger by a sincere repentance, and that we may merit by our good works the grace to enjoy Thee eternally in heaven.

What a lesson for my pride and vanity, to behold thee clothed with a common gown, a simple neckerchief, a humble apron, and a cap completely covering thy ears and thy hair. Who could but admire thy carefulness in concealing thy angelic face from the eyes of the small boy? No sorrowful Mother, thou couldst not more forcibly reprove pride, luxuriousness and sensuality, the allurements of which make numberless victims, both in this world and in the next. Help me, O Mother, to fly from the world and its distractions; to lead an interior life in order to become like Saint Paul, the good odor of Christ unto God. Help me to understand better that, to keep my heart pure, I must endeavor to be humble, to love mortification and to shun the sinful pleasures of the world.\n\nConcluding Prayer\n\nLord Jesus Christ, who, in Thy infinite mercy, didst send to us on the mountain of La Salette Thy ever glorious Mother in order to remind us of our Christian duties, grant that, moved by her tears and docile to her warnings, we may appease in this life Thy just anger by a sincere repentance, and that we may merit by our good works the grace to enjoy Thee eternally in heaven.

Let thy tear-bedewed face always be before my eyes, that it may soften my heart, and impart to it the grace of a true repentance!

You should pray morning and evening. You know what my Son says about prayer in His Gospel: We ought always to pray, and not to faint, that is, not to be faint-hearted in prayer. For without me, that is, without my grace, you can do nothing meritorious for heaven. Remember that grace is granted only through prayer. But, says my Son, if you ask the Father anything in My name, He will give it to you. Ask, therefore, with a pure and righteous heart, confidently, submissively, perseveringly, and you shall receive. Prayer is the key of the heavenly treasures. The cry of your misery goest up to God, and mercy descends forthwith. If, then, you wish to be a saint, be a lover of prayer. I myself pray incessantly for you in heaven. –O sweet Mother, help me to understand the deep meaning of these few words! I will never forget that prayer is a necessity for the human heart, and the happiness of life.\n\nConcluding Prayer\n\nLord Jesus Christ, who, in Thy infinite mercy, didst send to us on the mountain of La Salette Thy ever glorious Mother in order to remind us of our Christian duties, grant that, moved by her tears and docile to her warnings, we may appease in this life Thy just anger by a sincere repentance, and that we may merit by our good works the grace to enjoy Thee eternally in heaven.

And yet, this is exactly what we learn from one of thy maternal reproaches: They go to Mass, sayest thou, only to scoff at religion! Alas! how many Catholics are there, who keep entirely away from the church? And if they do go, their evil dispositions make them all the more guilty. How many poor sinners are there, who, instead of going to the sacred fountains of the Sacraments to quench the fire of their unruly passions, scornfully disdain these divine gifts and sacrilegiously profane them! Would to God that, with thy all powerful help, I should never defile my soul with a sacrilege! My confessions shall always be as sincere as I would have them when my last day comes. Henceforth my respectful behavior in assisting, at Mass, will prove my tender love and my profound esteem for this holy Sacrifice.\n\nConcluding Prayer\n\nLord Jesus Christ, who, in Thy infinite mercy, didst send to us on the mountain of La Salette Thy ever glorious Mother in order to remind us of our Christian duties, grant that, moved by her tears and docile to her warnings, we may appease in this life Thy just anger by a sincere repentance, and that we may merit by our good works the grace to enjoy Thee eternally in heaven.

How greatly they increase and strengthen my confidence in thee! O amiable Mother, how mercifully thou bearest the rebukes encountered in thy endeavors to bring back to God the hearts of thy erring children. One may remain deaf to the call of thy love and engaging goodness; but he will yield to thy tears. For the tears of a mother go straight to the heart and melt it. But, as regards those whose hardened hearts despise even thy tears, thou hast awful threats and terrible chastisements in store for them. Yet, even then, how much like those of a mother are thy reproofs and punishments! With one hand thou strikest, while with the other thou upholdest. Even when we go astray, thy watchful and maternal eyes follow us in the minutest details of life, to detect the slightest good sentiments of our hearts, in order to reward them.

Love rejoices to express itself by sacrifices and devotedness. Teach, then, all those about you the necessity of serving God. Make known to them the religious observances, and the delight found in the service of God. And, to fulfill this sacred duty, meditate upon the teachings of my Apparition.

Amen.\n\nIntro Prayer\n\nGlory be to thee, O Jesus, Lion of the Tribe of Juda! that hast raised up in thy Church a Lion to defend her in those dark times, when holy Faith was most exposed to danger. \nThou chargedst Peter to confirm his Brethren (St. Luke, xxii. 32.); and we have seen Leo, in whom Peter lived, fulfil this office with sovereign authority. We have heard the acclamation of the holy Council, which, in admiration at the heavenly teachings of Leo, proclaimed the signal favour thou conferredst on thy Flock, when thou badest Peter feed both Sheep and Lambs.\nO holy Pontiff Leo! thou worthily representedst Peter in his Chair, whence thy apostolic teaching ceased not to flow, ever beautiful in its truth and majesty. The Church of thine own day honoured thee as the great Teacher of Faith; and the Church of every succeeding age has recognised thee as one of the most learned Doctors and preachers of the divine Word. \nFrom thy throne in heaven, where now thou reignest, pour forth upon us the understanding of the great Mystery which thou wast called on to defend. Under thy inspired pen, this mystery grows clear; we see how sublimely it harmonises with all other mysteries; and Faith delights at gaining so close a view of the divine object of its belief. Oh! strengthen this Faith within us. \nThe Incarnate Word is blasphemed in these our own times; avenge his glory, by sending us men of thy zeal and learning.\n\nConcluding Prayer\n\nThou triumphedst over barbarian invaders, Attila acknowledged the influence of thy sanctity and eloquence, by withdrawing his troops from the Christian land they infested. \nIn these our days, there have risen up new barbarians,–civilized barbarians, who would persuade us, that religion should be eliminated from Education, and that the State, in its laws and institutions, should simply ignore our Lord Jesus Christ, the King to whom all power has been given, not only in heaven but on Earth also (St. Matth. xxviii. 18). \nOh! help us by thy powerful intercession, for our danger is extreme. Many are seduced, and are apostates whilst flattering themselves that they are still Christians. \nPray that the light, that is left within us, may not be extinguished, and that the public scandals, which now exist, may be brought to an end. Attila was but a pagan; our modern statesmen and Governments are, or, at least, call themselves, Christians, have pity on them, and gain for them light to see the precipice to which they are hurrying society.\nThese days of Paschal Time must remind thee, O holy Pontiff! of the Easters thou didst once spend, here on earth, when, surrounded by the Neophytes, thou gavest them the nourishment of thy magnificent Discourses, pray for the Faithful, who have this Easter, risen to a new life with Christ. \nWhat they most stand in need of is, a fuller and better knowledge of this their Saviour, in order that they may cling more closely to him, and persevere in his holy service. Thy prayers must get them this knowledge; by thy prayers, thou must teach them what he is both in his Divine and Human Nature, that, as God, He is their Last End, and their Judge after death; as Man, their Brother, their Redeemer, their Model. \nBless, O Leo! and help the Pontiff who is now thy successor on the Chair of Peter. Show now thy love for that Rome, whose sacred and eternal destinies were so frequently the subject of thy glowing and heavenly eloquence.\nWe also ask, St Leo, that you pray for us in our intention (mention your request here…)\nPope St Leo the Great, pray for us!\nAmen.",

Attila was but a pagan; our modern statesmen and Governments are, or, at least, call themselves, Christians, have pity on them, and gain for them light to see the precipice to which they are hurrying society.\nThese days of Paschal Time must remind thee, O holy Pontiff! of the Easters thou didst once spend, here on earth, when, surrounded by the Neophytes, thou gavest them the nourishment of thy magnificent Discourses, pray for the Faithful, who have this Easter, risen to a new life with Christ. \nWhat they most stand in need of is, a fuller and better knowledge of this their Saviour, in order that they may cling more closely to him, and persevere in his holy service. Thy prayers must get them this knowledge; by thy prayers, thou must teach them what he is both in his Divine and Human Nature, that, as God, He is their Last End, and their Judge after death; as Man, their Brother, their Redeemer, their Model. \nBless, O Leo! and help the Pontiff who is now thy successor on the Chair of Peter. Show now thy love for that Rome, whose sacred and eternal destinies were so frequently the subject of thy glowing and heavenly eloquence.\nWe also ask, St Leo, that you pray for us in our intention (mention your request here…)\nPope St Leo the Great, pray for us!\nAmen.\n\nSend me your answered prayers from the Pope St Leo the Great Novena",

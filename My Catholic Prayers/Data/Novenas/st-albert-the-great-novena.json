May St. Albert the Great help ease our anxiety as we study, prepare, and take exams. \nAll this we ask in Jesus Name, Amen.\nO God, who did richly adorn St. Albert with your heavenly gifts and decorated him with all virtues, grant that, following in his footsteps, we may persevere in your service until death and securely obtain an everlasting reward.

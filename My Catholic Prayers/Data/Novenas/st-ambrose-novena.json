Amen.\n\nIntro Prayer\n\nPrayer of St Ambrose (Especially Before Holy Mass)\nLord Jesus Christ, I approach Thy banquet table in fear and trembling, for I am a sinner, and dare not rely on my own worth, but only on Thy goodness and mercy. \nI am defiled by my many sins in body and soul, and by my unguarded thoughts and words. \nGracious God of majesty and awe, I seek Thy protection, I look for Thy healing. \nPoor troubled sinner that I am, I appeal to Thee, the fountain of all mercy. \nI cannot bear Thy judgment, but I trust in Thy salvation. \nLord, I show my wounds to Thee and uncover my shame before Thee. \nI know my sins are many and great, and they fill me with fear, but I hope in Thy mercies, for they cannot be numbered. \nLord Jesus Christ, Eternal King, God and man, crucified for mankind, look upon me with mercy and hear my prayer, for I trust in Thee. \nHave mercy on me, full of sorrow and sin, for the depth of Thy compassion never ends. \nPraise to Thee saving sacrifice, offered on the wood of the cross for me and for all mankind. \nPraise to the noble and precious Blood, flowing from the wounds of my crucified Lord Jesus Christ and washing away the sins of the whole world. \nRemember, Lord, Thy creature, whom Thou hast redeemed with Thy blood; I repent my sins, and I long to put right what I have done. \nMerciful Father, take away all my offenses and sins; purify me in body and soul, and make me worthy to taste the Holy of Holies. \nMay Thy Body and Blood, which I intend to receive, although I am unworthy, be for me the remission of my sins, the washing away of my guilt, the end of my evil thoughts, and the rebirth of my better instincts. \nMay it incite me to do the works pleasing to Thee, and a firm defense of body and soul against the wiles of my enemies. Amen.\n\nConcluding Prayer\n\nHoly St. Ambrose, you are known as the Honey Tongued Doctor because of your ability to help others learn the truth of Christianity.\nGod blessed you with faith, understanding, and the great ability to preach the sweet words of the Gospel.\nWe invoke your powerful intercession, confident in the hope that you will hear our prayers and obtain for us abundant special graces from our heavenly Father.\nOur Father Hail Mary Glory Be\nSt Ambrose of Milan, pray for us!",

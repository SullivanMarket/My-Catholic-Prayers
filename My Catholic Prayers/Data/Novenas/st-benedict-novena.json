Behold me, humbly kneeling at thy feet. \nI implore thy loving heart to pray for me before the throne of God. \nTo thee I have recourse in all the dangers which daily surround me. \nShield me against my enemies, inspire me to imitate thee in all things. \nMay thy blessing be with me always, so that I may shun whatever God forbids and avoid the occasions of sin. \nGraciously obtain for me from God those favors and graces of which I stand so much in need, in the trials, miseries and afflictions of life.  Thy heart was always so full of love, compassion, and mercy toward those who were afflicted or troubled in any way. \nThou didst never dismiss without consolation and assistance anyone who had recourse to thee. \nI therefore invoke thy powerful intercession, in the confident hope that thou wilt hear my prayers and obtain for me the special grace and favor I so earnestly implore (mention your intentions here), if it be for the greater glory of God and the welfare of my soul. Amen.\n\nConcluding Prayer\n\nHelp me, O great St. Benedict, to live and die as a faithful child of God, to be ever submissive to His holy will, and to attain the eternal happiness of heaven. Amen.",

I pray that I will have the same love toward all I meet, especially those who are different than me.\nSt. Damien, you were a spiritual minister and leader to people with leprosy. Thus, you were not too proud to work with the most outcast members of society. Help me to remember those in my own life and culture who are seen as outsiders. Remind me to invite them into my world to make them feel welcome and respected.\nKeep me from treating those who are different as unworthy of love and respect. Help me to remember that all people are equal in God’s eyes.\nAs the patron of lepers, I bring to you in my heart all those who suffer from terminal illnesses and all of those who feel outcast from society in some way.

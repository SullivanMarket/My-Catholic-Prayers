In her youth she lovingly sought You and drew other young people to You, involving them in the care of the sick and the elderly. We thank You for the gift of this young woman so deeply committed to You. Through her example, give us the grace to dedicate our lives to Your service, for the joy of our brothers and sisters.  Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the beginning, is now and ever shall be world without end. Amen.  Jesus, Redeemer of humanity, You called St. Gianna to become a doctor, a role she lived as a mission to comfort bodies and souls. She saw You in the sick, needy and weak. We thank You because, through this servant, You revealed Yourself to us as “One who serves” and alleviates the sufferings of all men and women.  As we treasure her example, may we become generous Christians at the service of our brothers and sisters, especially toward those with whom You wish to share Your Cross.  Glory be…  God, Sanctifying Spirit, You love the Church as Your bride. You poured into the heart of St. Gianna a share of Your love so that she could give it to her family, cooperate with You in the wonderful plan of creation, and give life to new children who would know and love You.  We thank You for this model wife and for her encouraging example. Grant us serene and Christian mothers who are committed to transforming our families into cenacles of faith, love, generosity, and service. Glory be…  O God, Creator and Lover of the human family, You remained with St. Gianna when she painfully had to choose between her life and the life of the child she had awaited for so long. Trusting You alone and aware of Your commandment to respect human life, St. Gianna found the courage to do her duty as a mother and to say “yes” to her baby’s life, thus generously sacrificing her own.  Through the intercession of Mary, Mother of Jesus, and by the example of St. Gianna, inspire all mothers to welcome with love the seeds of a new life. Help us respect the gift of human life.  Grant us the grace to find inspiration in St. Gianna, a model spouse and mother who, following the example of Christ, gave up her life for the life of others.  3 Hail Marys… Amen.",

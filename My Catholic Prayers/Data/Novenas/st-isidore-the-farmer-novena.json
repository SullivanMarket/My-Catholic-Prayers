You attended Holy Mass each morning, which jeopardized the employment that allowed your family to eat.  The Lord repaid your love by sending His angels to plow the fields while you were at Church.  Dear Isidore, ask Our Lord Jesus to place deep faith in our hearts and water it each day with your prayers that we may progress in holiness as you did.  Pray that as our heart grows in love and humility we may be a living sign of Jesus to those around us.  As a farmer who used his hands to bring forth nourishing food, please ask Jesus to bless us with a bountiful harvest.  Pray that our hands and bodies will remain strong that we may farm the land God has given us.  Ask Jesus to care for our gardens as he tends our hearts.  Pray that weeds will be kept far from our fields and likewise give us an aversion to sin.  Humbly we ask that you carry the petitions we hold in our heart to our most loving and generous Lord.  Amen.\n\nConcluding Prayer\n\nOur Father Hail Mary Glory Be",

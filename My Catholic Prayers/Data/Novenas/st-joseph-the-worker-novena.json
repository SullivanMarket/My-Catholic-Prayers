Thou art the faithful protector and intercessor of all who love and venerate thee. \nThou knowest that I have special confidence in thee and that, after Our Lord and Our Lady, I place all my hope of salvation in thee, for thou art especially powerful with God and will never abandon thy faithful servants. \nTherefore I humbly invoke thee and commend myself, with all who are dear to me and all that belongs to me, to thy intercession.\nI beg thee, by thy love for Our Lord and Our Lady, not to abandon me during life and to assist me at the hour of my death.

Be my guide, my father and my model through life that I may merit to die as Thou didst in the arms of Our Lord and Our Lady.\nLoving Saint Joseph, faithful follower of Jesus Christ, I raise my heart to thee to implore thy powerful intercession in obtaining from the Divine Heart of Jesus all the graces necessary for my spiritual and temporal welfare, particularly the grace of a happy death and the special grace I now implore:\n(Mention your request).\nGuardian of the Word Incarnate, I feel confident that thy prayers on my behalf will be graciously heard before the throne of God. Amen.\nRemember, most pure spouse of Mary, ever Virgin, my loving protector, Saint Joseph, that no one ever had recourse to thy protection or asked for thy aid without obtaining relief. Confiding, therefore, in thy goodness, I come before thee and humbly implore thee. Despise not my petitions, foster-father of the Redeemer, but graciously receive them. Amen.\n\nConcluding Prayer\n\nPope Leo XIII’s Prayer to St Joseph (from Quamquam Pluries)\nTo thee, O blessed Joseph, we have recourse in our affliction, and having implored the help of thy thrice holy Spouse, we now, with hearts filled with confidence, earnestly beg thee also to take us under thy protection. \nBy that charity wherewith thou wert united to the Immaculate Virgin Mother of God, and by that fatherly love with which thou didst cherish the Child Jesus, we beseech thee and we humbly pray that thou wilt look down with gracious eye upon that inheritance which Jesus Christ purchased by His blood, and wilt succor us in our need by thy power and strength.\nDefend, O most watchful guardian of the Holy Family, the chosen off-spring of Jesus Christ. Keep from us, O most loving Father, all blight of error and corruption. Aid us from on high, most valiant defender, in this conflict with the powers of darkness. \nAnd even as of old thou didst rescue the Child Jesus from the peril of His life, so now defend God’s Holy Church from the snares of the enemy and from all adversity. Shield us ever under thy patronage, that, following thine example and strengthened by thy help, we may live a holy life, die a happy death, and attain to everlasting bliss in Heaven. Amen.",

Aid us from on high, most valiant defender, in this conflict with the powers of darkness. \nAnd even as of old thou didst rescue the Child Jesus from the peril of His life, so now defend God’s Holy Church from the snares of the enemy and from all adversity. Shield us ever under thy patronage, that, following thine example and strengthened by thy help, we may live a holy life, die a happy death, and attain to everlasting bliss in Heaven. Amen.",

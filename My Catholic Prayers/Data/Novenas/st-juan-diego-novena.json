Let not your heart be disturbed. Do not fear that sickness, nor any other sickness or anguish. Am I not here, who is your Mother? Are you not under my protection? Am I not your health? Are you not happily within my mantle? What else do you wish? Do not grieve nor be disturbed by anything.\nO St. Juan Diego, Our Lady of Guadalupe chose you as her faithful messenger.\nYou demonstrated your complete faith in her, and to this day it is visible in the miraculous image the Virgin left upon your tilma.\nIntercede for me, I pray, that I might have your childlike trust in the Mother of God, and that my heart might respond to her maternal promptings, especially I ask for (mention your request here…)\nThrough such simple confidence, obedience, and love, may I join you one day in sharing everlasting joy, where our heavenly Mother reigns in the glory of Her Son.\nAmen.\n\nConcluding Prayer\n\nOur Father Hail Mary Glory Be\nSt Juan Diego, pray for us!",

We implore you to obtain for us a perfect and constant devotion to Mary that we may participate in the faith, hope, and charity of Our Lady and that we may receive the favor we ask of you in this novena (mention your request here).\nOur Father Hail Mary Glory Be\nSt. Louis de Montfort… pray for us (x3)\nI pray to Jesus in your words, dear St Louis:\nO most loving Jesus, deign to let me pour forth my gratitude before Thee, for the grace Thou hast bestowed upon me in giving me to Thy holy Mother through the devotion of Holy Bondage, that she may be my advocate in the presence of Thy majesty and my support in my extreme misery. \nAlas, O Lord! I am so wretched that without this dear Mother I should be certainly lost. \nYes, Mary is necessary for me at Thy side and everywhere that she may appease Thy just wrath, because I have so often offended Thee; that she may save me from the eternal punishment of Thy justice, which I deserve; that she may contemplate Thee, speak to Thee, pray to Thee, approach Thee and please Thee; that she may help me to save my soul and the souls of others; in short, Mary is necessary for me that I may always do Thy holy will and seek Thy greater glory in all things. \nAh, would that I could proclaim throughout the whole world the mercy that Thou hast shown to me! \nWould that everyone might know I should be already damned, were it not for Mary!  Would that I might offer worthy thanksgiving for so great a blessing!\nMary is in me. \nOh, what a treasure!  Oh, what a consolation! \nAnd shall I not be entirely hers?  Oh, what ingratitude! \nMy dear Saviour, send me death rather than such a calamity, for I would rather die than live without belonging entirely to Mary. \nWith St. John the Evangelist at the foot of the Cross, I have taken her a thousand times for my own and as many times have given myself to her; but if I have not yet done it as Thou, dear Jesus, dost wish, I now renew this offering as Thou dost desire me to renew it. \nAnd if Thou seest in my soul or my body anything that does not belong to this august princess, I pray Thee to take it and cast it far from me, for whatever in me does not belong to Mary is unworthy of Thee.\nO Holy Spirit, grant me all these graces. \nPlant in my soul the Tree of true Life, which is Mary; cultivate it and tend it so that it may grow and blossom and bring forth the fruit of life in abundance. \nO Holy Spirit, give me great devotion to Mary, Thy faithful spouse; give me great confidence in her maternal heart and an abiding refuge in her mercy, so that by her Thou mayest truly form in me Jesus Christ, great and mighty, unto the fullness of His perfect age. Amen.\n\nConcluding Prayer\n\nO God, Who in the power of the Holy Spirit hast made St Louis de Montfort an ardent apostle of Christ Crucified and a faithful son of the Virgin Mary, grant that through his example and intercession we may be renewed in the spirit of our baptism and be always faithful to Our Lord Jesus Christ, Who liveth and reigneth with Thee and the Holy Spirit, one God, forever and ever.

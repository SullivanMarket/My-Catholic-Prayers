Help us to put aside personal interests and abandon ourselves entirely and lovingly to His Adorable Heart.  May our work, like yours, merit His special care and favor, through Jesus’ Holy Name.  St Margaret Mary, we implore you, to whom the Sacred Heart of Jesus manifested His Divine treasures, to obtain the graces we seek from His Adorable Heart.

An appeal from you to that merciful Heart you loved so well, must surely be irresistible.  Obtain for me this one request, that I may be ever united to the Adorable Heart of Jesus in all that It has ever done or will do for the glory of God and the salvation of man.  Ask also for me, O ardent lover of Jesus, the grant of the humble and earnest petition I now put up to Heaven through your hands.  (Mention your request here again…)\n\nConcluding Prayer\n\nPray for us, O Blessed Margaret Mary, that we may ardently love the Sacred Heart of Jesus.  Let us pray:  We thank You, O Lord Jesus, for having established in these our days, a most special and tender devotion towards Your loving Heart, by means of Your humble servant, Blessed Margaret Mary, and may we so feel the benefit of her favor in Your sight, as to receive through her powerful prayers whatever we ask for, or do now stand most in need of, to Your honor and glory, who with the Father, and the Holy Ghost, lives and reign forever and ever.  Amen.  Sacred Heart of Jesus, Immaculate Heart of Mary, and Noble Heart of Joseph, bless and protect the Church.  Amen.",

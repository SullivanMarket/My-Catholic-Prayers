Amen.\n\nIntro Prayer\n\nSan Pedro Calungsod, student, catechist, missionary, faithful friend, martyr, you inspire us by your fidelity through adversity, by your courage in teaching the Faith in the midst of hostility, and by your love when you shed your blood for the sake of the Gospel. Make our prayers your own.\n(mention request here…)\nand intercede for us before the throne of Mercy and Grace so that, as we experience the help of Heaven, we may be encouraged to live and proclaim the Gospel here on earth.\n\nConcluding Prayer\n\nLord Jesus Christ, we kneel before You in worship, praise and thanksgiving for the infinite love that you have shown to us sinners through your humble Incarnation, bitter Passion, and cruel death on the Cross. \nBy Your wounds we are healed. By Your death, we are restored to life. Forgive us for not having returned love for Your love. \nIn Your suffering, You have left us an example so that we may follow in Your footsteps. The life of Your young martyr and our brother, San Pedro Calungsod, proves to us that it is possible to follow You even up to death.\nBe pleased with this novena that we are making in his memory. \nWith his help, we shall strive to be living witnesses to Your love, through patient endurance in daily trials and selfless service to our neighbor, so that after having joined You in Your redeeming Passion here on earth, we may also come to share in Your glorious Resurrection at the end of time and love You eternally in Heaven, where You live and reign with the Father and the Holy Spirit, one God forever and ever. Amen.\nOur Father Hail Mary Glory Be\nSaint Pedro Calungsod, Pray for us.",

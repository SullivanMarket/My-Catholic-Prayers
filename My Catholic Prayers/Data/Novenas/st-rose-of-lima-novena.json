You were indeed a rose among thorns, bearing, with meekness and patience, the stings of envious tongues, while preserving perfect purity and modesty amid the alluring blandishments of a deceitful world.  To the sufferings inflicted on you by others, St Rose of Lima, you added the voluntary tortures of fasting and watching, of a crown of thorns and of a hair shirt, to subdue the flesh and to make yourself like your heavenly Spouse.  By the merits you gained with your Divine Bridegroom, obtain for me the grace to bear my afflictions with patience, to remain pure and modest, to be meek and humble, to be faithful to the inspirations of the Holy Spirit, and so to mortify my passions that I may be ever more pleasing and acceptable in the sight of my dear Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, Who lives and reigns world without end.  Amen.  St Rose of Lima, Pray for Us.\n\nConcluding Prayer\n\nOur Father Hail Mary Glory Be",

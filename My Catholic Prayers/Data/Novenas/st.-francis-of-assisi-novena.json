Where there is patience and humility, there is neither anger nor disturbance.  Where there is poverty with joy, there is neither covetousness nor avarice.  Where there is inner peace and meditation, there is neither anxiousness nor dissipation.  Where there is fear of the Lord to guard the house (cf. Lk. 11:21), there the enemy cannot gain entry.  Where there is mercy and discernment, there is neither excess nor hardness of heart.\n\nConcluding Prayer\n\nGlorious Saint Francis, who voluntarily renounced all the comforts and riches of thy home to follow more perfectly the life of poverty and abnegation of Jesus Christ: Obtain for us, we pray, a generous contempt of all things in this world, that we may secure the true and eternal things of heaven.  Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit. Amen.  O glorious Saint Francis, who during the whole course of thy life continually wept over the passion of the Redeemer, and labored most zealously for the salvation of souls: Obtain for us, we pray, the grace of weeping continually over those sins by which we have crucified afresh Our Lord Jesus Christ, that we may attain to be of the number of those who shall eternally bless His supreme mercy.  Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit. Amen.  O glorious Saint Francis, who, loving above all things suffering and the Cross, merited to bear in thy body the miraculous stigmata, by which thou becamest a living image of Jesus Christ crucified: Obtain for us, we pray, the grace to bear in our bodies the mortifications of Christ, that we may merit one day to receive the consolations which are infallibly promised to all those who now weep.  Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit. Amen.",

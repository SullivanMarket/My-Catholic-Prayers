Grant that I also may learn to turn all the circumstances and events of my life into opportunities to love you and serve the Church, the Pope, and all souls, with joy and simplicity, lighting up the paths of the earth with faith and love.  Through the intercession of St. Josemaria, please grant me the favor I request (mention your request here). Amen.\n\nDaily Prayer\n\n“We have come to call attention once again to the example of Jesus, who spent thirty years in Nazareth, working as a carpenter. In his hands, a professional occupation, similar to that carried out by millions of people all over the world, was turned into a divine task. It became a part of our Redemption, a way to salvation.” (Conversations with Monsignor Josemaría Escrivá, 55)\n\nMay our Lord God help me see my job as a path to holiness and a service to others, where God my Father awaits me at every moment, asking me, in each situation, to imitate Jesus when he worked as a carpenter in Nazareth.\n\nConcluding Prayer\n\nOur Father, Hail Mary, Glory Be.",

For the true Christian these words ring deep down in his heart as a reproach to his lack of generosity, and as a constant invitation to be loyal. Brief indeed is our time for loving, for giving, for making atonement. It would be very wrong, therefore, for us to waste it, or to cast this treasure irresponsibly overboard. We mustn’t squander this period of the world’s history that God has entrusted to each one of us.” (Friends of God, 39)\n\nWith the help of the Most Blessed Virgin Mary, may I learn to use my time as the treasure it is, and make the effort to improve in the virtue of order, so as to work more punctually, intensely and constantly, without disorder or delays. May I achieve this by following a well-structured plan, which allows for me to spend the appropriate amount of time on each of my duties: spiritual life, family life, professional life and social relations, in a balanced way.\n\nConcluding Prayer\n\nOur Father, Hail Mary, Glory Be.",

Amen.\n\nDaily Prayer\n\n“It is no good offering to God something that is less perfect than our poor human limitations permit. The work that we offer must be without blemish and it must be done as carefully as possible, even in its smallest details, for God will not accept shoddy workmanship. ‘Thou shalt not offer anything that is faulty,’ Holy Scripture warns us (Lev 22:20), ‘because it would not be worthy of him.’\n\nFor that reason, the work of each one of us, the activities that take up our time and energy, must be an offering worthy of our Creator. It must be operatio Dei, a work of God that is done for God: in short, a task that is complete and faultless.” (Friends of God, 55)\n\nMay God help me to work well, with the greatest possible perfection. May I never work carelessly, but be convinced that work done badly cannot be sanctified, because it lacks love, and love alone enables any human action to be pleasing to God.\n\nConcluding Prayer\n\nOur Father, Hail Mary, Glory Be.",

Work, all work, bears witness to the dignity of man, to his dominion over creation.” (Christ is Passing By, 47)\n\nIf my present job is below my level of competence and my legitimate aspirations, may I not belittle it. Rather, while seeking something more appropriate, may I carry it out in a fully responsible way, giving it the same value as Jesus gave his work at Nazareth.\n\nConcluding Prayer\n\nOur Father, Hail Mary, Glory Be.",

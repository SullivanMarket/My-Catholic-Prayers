Amen.\n\nIntro Prayer\n\nSaint Mary Goretti who, strengthened by God’s grace, did not hesitate, even at a young age, to shed your blood and sacrifice life itself to defend your virginal purity, look graciously on the unhappy human race, which has strayed far from the path of eternal salvation. Teach us all, and especially youth, with what courage and promptitude we should flee for the love of Jesus, anything that could offend Him or stain our souls with sin. Obtain for us from our Lord victory in temptation, comfort in the sorrows of life, and the grace which we earnestly beg of Thee, (Mention your intention here) and may we one day enjoy with Thee the imperishable glory of heaven.\nAmen.\n\nDaily Prayer\n\nDear Saint Mary Goretti, once again I turn to you, and beg of you in the words of Our Holy Father, Pope Pius XII, that serenity of spirit and deep joy which is the heritage of those who are pure of heart.\n\nHelp me to turn to Our Blessed Lady, confident in the hope that she will take my hand as she did yours, and lead me on to Paradise, my heavenly country, there to enjoy with you and Her, the company of God the Father, Son and Holy Ghost for all Eternity.\n\nConcluding Prayer\n\nPray the Litany of the Blessed Virgin Mary  Lord, have mercy on us Christ, have mercy on us Lord, have mercy on us Christ, hear us Christ, graciously hear us  God the Father of heaven, have mercy on us.

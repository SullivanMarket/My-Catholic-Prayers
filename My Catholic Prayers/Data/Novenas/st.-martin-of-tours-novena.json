Amen.\n\nIntro Prayer\n\nBlessed Saint Martín of Tours, full of the Spirit of the Lord always having inexhaustible charity for the needy.  You, who full of love and generosity when you saw the beggar that was freezing from cold, without knowing that in truth he was Christ, did not doubt to give him half of your cape,  and did not give it completely to him  since the other half belonged to the Roman army; you, who did not seek recognition  but only to favor your neighbor,  found glory before the Lord. And when the Savior appeared to you dressed with the half-cape so as to express appreciation for your gesture and He told you “today you covered me with your mantle”, you decided to no longer serve the army and to dedicate your life to God and to the salvation of souls,  being from then on a propagator of the faith and a holy man totally dedicated to whomever was in need.  Glorious Saint Martin, you who worked miracles and prodigies, who with joy, amiability and the most exquisite goodness won over the hearts of all and did not cease to ever work for their wellbeing:  give me your hand and help me to come out of all lack and scarcity which today afflicts me and weighs me down.  Glorious Saint Martin, my blessed patron, I humbly ask you with great faith that you attain from God, the fount of all Mercies that my ways on this earth, my work and my toils be cleansed and opened with clarity.  In the name of Omnipotent God, Saint Martin of Tours, remove all that harms me and give me work and prosperity.  O blessed relief, give me your saintly protection, assist me, I beg you, in these difficult times:  (mention your request here)\n\nConcluding Prayer\n\nYou, noble Saint Martin, who have miraculous power take my supplications with haste to the Heavens, ask for my home all that is good;  may sorrows, ruins and miseries leave,  and may the Lord deign I merit blessed fortune in my work (business), and with it, abundance and prosperity, so I may give freely to all in need.  Saint Martin, blessed Bishop of Tours,  may your virtues and charity accompany me always. I will not cease to pray to you and to thank Almighty God for all the favors granted; and I promise to be charitable and giving with all my brothers and sisters in need.  Saint Martin please intercede for me; free and protect all my loved ones and me from all that is evil.  Amen.",

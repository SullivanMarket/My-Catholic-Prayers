Amen.\n\nIntro Prayer\n\nExemplary Mother of the Great Augustine, you perserveringly pursued your wayward son not with wild threats but with prayerful cries to heaven.  Intercede for all mothers in our day so that they may learn to draw their children to God. Teach them how to remain close to their children, even the prodigal sons and daughters who have sadly gone astray.\n\nDaily Prayer\n\nToday we pray for all God’s people who have left the Church. May the Holy Spirit open their ears and hearts so they may hear this invitation to come home.\n\nConcluding Prayer\n\nDear St Monica, troubled wife and mother, many sorrows pierced your heart during your lifetime. Yet you never despaired or lost faith. With confidence, persistence and profound faith, you prayed daily for the conversion of your beloved husband, Patricius and your beloved son, Augustine.  Grant me that same fortitude, patience and trust in the Lord. Intercede for me, dear St. Monica, that God may favorably hear my plea for (mention your petition here).  And grant me the grace to accept his will in all things, through Jesus Christ, our Lord, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God forever and ever. Amen.",

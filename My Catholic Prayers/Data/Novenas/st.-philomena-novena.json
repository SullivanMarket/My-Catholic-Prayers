But like the first Christians, you found solace being with your brothers and sisters with whom you broke bread, sharing in the Eucharist in the catacombs. You received the Body and Blood of Jesus with devotion, knowing that he alone would be able to help you weather the persecutions. I implore you, my dear saint, to help me love the Eucharist, to receive Jesus daily through the Holy Communion. Bless also my brothers and sisters, especially the sick, who are unable to receive Jesus daily. May Jesus’ presence enable them to accept the sufferings they are passing through.

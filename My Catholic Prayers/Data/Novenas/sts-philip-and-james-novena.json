Gain for me that low esteem of self with which you were gifted. \nObtain for me a knowledge of my own nothingness, that I may rejoice when I am despised, and ever seek to be great only in the eyes of my God and Judge.\nYour hearts were burning with love, but mine is all frozen towards God, and alive only for creatures. I love the world, which can never make me happy. \nMy highest desire is to be well off here below. O my God, when shall I learn to love nothing else but Thee? \nGain for me, O Philip and James, a pure love, a strong love, and an efficacious love, that, loving God here upon earth, I may enjoy the sight of Him, together with you and all saints, hereafter in heaven.\nAmen\n\nConcluding Prayer\n\nOur Father Hail Mary Glory Be\nSts Philip and James, pray for us!",
